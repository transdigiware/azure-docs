      - question: |
          What are all of the prerequisites required to enable Azure Automanage?
        answer: |
          The following are prerequisites for enabling Azure Automanage:
          - Supported [Windows Server versions](automanage-windows-server.md#supported-windows-server-versions) and [Linux distros](automanage-linux.md#supported-linux-distributions-and-versions)
          - VMs must be in a supported region
          - User must have correct permissions
          - Non-scale set VMs only
          - Automanage does not support Sandbox subscriptions at this time
          
      - question: |
          What Azure RBAC permission is needed to enable Automanage?
        answer: |
          If you are enabling Automanage on an VM with an existing Automanage Account, you need Contributor role to the Resource Group where the VM resides.
          
          If you are using a new Automanage Account when enabling, you must have either the Owner role or have Contributor + User Access Administrator role to the subscription.

          What regions are supported?

      - question: |
          Which capabilities does Azure Automanage automate?
        answer: |
          Automanage enrolls, configures, and monitors throughout the lifecycle of the VM the services listed [here](automanage-virtual-machines.md).
          
      - question: |
          Does Azure Automanage work with Azure Arc-enabled VMs?
        answer: |

        answer: |
          Customers can customize settings for specific services, like Azure Backup retention, through configuration preferences. For the full list of settings that can be changed, see our documentation [here](automanage-virtual-machines.md#customizing-an-environment-using-preferences).

      - question: |
          Can I selectively apply Automanage on only a set of VMs?
        answer: |
          Automanage can be enabled with click and point simplicity on selected new and existing VMs. Automanage can also be disabled at any time.

      - question: |
          Can I apply Automanage through Azure policy?
        answer: |
          Yes, we have a built-in policy that will automatically apply Automanage to all VMs within your defined scope. You will also specify the environment configuration (DevTest or Production) along with your Automanage account. Learn more about enabling Automanage through Azure policy [here](virtual-machines-policy-enable.md).
          
          
      - question: |
          What is an Automanage account?
        answer: |
          The Automanage Account is an MSI (Managed Service Identity) that provides the security context or the identity under which the automated operations occur.
          
          
      - question: |
          When enabling Automanage, does it impact any additional machines besides the machine(s) I selected?
        answer: |
          If your VM is linked to an existing Log Analytics workspace, we will reuse that workspace to apply these solutions: Change Tracking, Inventory, and Update Management. All machines connected to that workspace will have those solutions enabled.
          
          
      - question: |
          Can I change the environment of my machine?
        answer: |
          At this time, you will need to disable Automanage for that machine and then re-enable Automanage with the desired environment and preferences.
          
          
      - question: |
          If my machine is already configured for a service, like Update Management, will Automanage reconfigure it?
        answer: |
          No, Automanage will not reconfigure it. We will begin to monitor the resources associated to that service for drift.
          
          
      - question: |
          Why does my machine have a Failed status in the Automanage portal?
        answer: |
          If you see the status as *Failed*, you can troubleshoot the deployment in a few different ways:
          * Go to **Resource groups**, select your resource group, click on **Deployments** and see the *Failed* status there along with error details.
          * Go to **Subscriptions**, select your resource group, click on **Deployments** and see the *Failed* status there along with error details.
          * You can also visit the activity log of a machine, which will contain an entry for "Create or Update Configuration Profile Assignments". This may also contain more details on your deployment.
          
      - question: |
          How can I get troubleshooting support for Automanage?
        answer: |
          You can file a [technical support case ticket](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest). For the **Service** option, search for and select *Automanage* under the *Monitoring and Management* section.
