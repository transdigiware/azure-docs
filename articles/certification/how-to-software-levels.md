# Software levels of Azure Certified Devices

Software levels are a feature defined by the Azure Certified Device program to help device builders indicate the technical level of difficulty a customer can expect when connecting the device to Azure services. Appearing on the catalog as "Azure software set-up," these values are aimed to help viewers better understand the product and its connection to Azure. The definitions of each of these levels are provided below.

## Level 1

User can immediately connect device to Azure by simply adding provisioning details. The certified IoT device already contains pre-installed software that was used for certification upon purchase. This level is most similar to having an "out-of-the-box" set-up experience for IoT beginners who are not as comfortable with compiling source code.

## Level 2

User must flash/apply manufacturer-provided software image to the device to connect to Azure. Extra tools/software experience may be required. The link to the software image is also provided in our catalog.

## Level 3

User must follow a manufacturer-provided guide to prepare and install Azure-specific software. No Azure-specific software image is provided, so some customization and compilation of provided source code is required.

## Level 4

User must develop, customize, and recompile their own device code to connect to Azure. No manufacturer-supported source code is available. This level is most well suited for developers looking to create custom deployments for their device.

## Next steps

These levels are aimed to help you get started with building IoT solutions with Azure! Ready to get started? Visit the [Azure Certified Device catalog](https://devicecatalog.azure.com) to get searching for devices!
