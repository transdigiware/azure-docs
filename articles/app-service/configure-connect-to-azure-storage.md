# Mount Azure Storage as a local share in a container app in App Service

::: zone pivot="container-windows"

> [!NOTE]
>Azure Storage in App Service Windows container is **in preview** and **not supported** for **production scenarios**.

This guide shows how to mount Azure Storage Files as a network share in a Windows container in App Service. Only [Azure Files Shares](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-cli.md) and [Premium Files Shares](../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md) are supported. The benefits of custom-mounted storage include:

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

This guide shows how to mount Azure Storage as a network share in a built-in Linux container or a custom Linux container in App Service. The benefits of custom-mounted storage include:

::: zone-end

- Configure persistent storage for your App Service app and manage the storage separately.
- Make static content like video and images readily available for your App Service app. 
- Write application log files or archive older application log to Azure File shares.  
- Share content across multiple apps or with other Azure services.

::: zone pivot="container-windows"

The following features are supported for Windows containers:

- Azure Files (read/write).
- Up to five mount points per app.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

The following features are supported for Linux containers:

- Secured access to storage accounts with [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) and [private links](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) (when [VNET integration](web-sites-integrate-with-vnet.md) is used).
- Azure Files (read/write).
- Azure Blobs (read-only).
- Up to five mount points per app.

::: zone-end

## Prerequisites

::: zone pivot="container-windows"

- [An existing Windows Container app in Azure App Service](quickstart-custom-container.md)
- [Create Azure file share](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-cli.md)
- [Upload files to Azure File share](../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md)

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

- An existing [App Service on Linux app](index.yml).
- An [Azure Storage Account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-cli)
- An [Azure file share and directory](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-cli.md).

::: zone-end

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Storage is non-default storage for App Service and billed separately, not included with App Service.
>

## Limitations

::: zone pivot="container-windows"

- Storage mounts are not supported for native Windows (non-containerized) apps.
- [Storage firewall](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md), [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network), and [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) are not supported.
- FTP/FTPS access to mounted storage not supported (use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)).
- Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and Azure SDK support is in preview.
- Mapping `D:\` or `D:\home` to custom-mounted storage is not supported.
- Drive letter assignments (`C:` to `Z:`) are not supported.
- Storage mounts cannot be used together with clone settings option during [deployment slot](deploy-staging-slots.md) creation.
- Storage mounts are not backed up when you [back up your app](manage-backup.md). Be sure to follow best practices to back up the Azure Storage accounts. 

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

- [Storage firewall](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md) is supported only through [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) and [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) (when [VNET integration](web-sites-integrate-with-vnet.md) is used). Custom DNS support is currently unavailable when the mounted Azure Storage account uses a private endpoint.
- FTP/FTPS access to custom-mounted storage is not supported (use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)).
- Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and Azure SDK support is in preview.
- Mapping `/` or `/home` to custom-mounted storage is not supported.
- Storage mounts cannot be used together with clone settings option during [deployment slot](deploy-staging-slots.md) creation.
- Storage mounts are not backed up when you [back up your app](manage-backup.md). Be sure to follow best practices to back up the Azure Storage accounts.

## Mount storage to Windows container

Use the [`az webapp config storage-account add`](/cli/azure/webapp/config/storage-account#az_webapp_config_storage_account_add) command. For example:

```azurecli
az webapp config storage-account add --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --custom-id <custom-id> --storage-type AzureFiles --share-name <share-name> --account-name <storage-account-name> --access-key "<access-key>" --mount-path <mount-path-directory>
```

- `--storage-type` must be `AzureFiles` for Windows containers. 
- `mount-path-directory` must be in the form `/path/to/dir` or `\path\to\dir` with no drive letter. It's always mounted on the `C:\` drive. Do no use `/` or `\` (the root directory).

Verify your storage is mounted by running the following command:

```azurecli
az webapp config storage-account list --resource-group <resource-group> --name <app-name>
```

## Mount storage to Linux container

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the app.
1. From the left navigation, click **Configuration** > **Path Mappings** > **New Azure Storage Mount**. 
1. Configure the storage mount according to the following table. When finished, click **OK**.

    | Setting | Description |
    |-|-|
    | **Name** | Name of the mount configuration. Spaces are not allowed. |
    | **Configuration options** | Select **Basic** if the storage account is not using [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) or [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md). Otherwise, select **Advanced**. |
    | **Storage accounts** | Azure Storage account. |
    | **Storage type** | Select the type based on the storage you want to mount. Azure Blobs only supports read-only access. |
    | **Storage container** or **Share name** | Files share or Blobs container to mount. |
    | **Access key** (Advanced only) | [Access key](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage.md) for your storage account. |
    | **Mount path** | Directory inside the Linux container to mount to Azure Storage. Do not use `/` (the root directory). |

    > [!CAUTION]
    > The directory specified in **Mount path** in the Linux container should be empty. Any content stored in this directory is deleted when the Azure Storage is mounted (if you specify a directory under `/home`, for example). If you are migrating files for an existing app, make a backup of the app and its content before you begin.
    >
    
# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Use the [`az webapp config storage-account add`](/cli/azure/webapp/config/storage-account#az_webapp_config_storage_account_add) command. 

```azurecli
az webapp config storage-account add --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --custom-id <custom-id> --storage-type AzureFiles --share-name <share-name> --account-name <storage-account-name> --access-key "<access-key>" --mount-path <mount-path-directory>
```

- `--storage-type` can be `AzureBlob` or `AzureFiles`. `AzureBlob` is read-only.
- `--mount-path` is the directory inside the Linux container to mount to Azure Storage. Do not use `/` (the root directory).

> [!CAUTION]
> The directory specified in `--mount-path` in the Linux container should be empty. Any content stored in this directory is deleted when the Azure Storage is mounted (if you specify a directory under `/home`, for example). If you are migrating files for an existing app, make a backup of the app and its content before you begin.

Verify your configuration by running the following command:

```azurecli
az webapp config storage-account list --resource-group <resource-group> --name <app-name>
```

::: zone-end

> [!NOTE]
> Adding, editing, or deleting a storage mount causes the app to be restarted. 

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

## Test the mounted storage

To validate that the Azure Storage is mounted successfully for the app:

1. [Open an SSH session](configure-linux-open-ssh-session.md) into the container.
1. In the SSH terminal, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    df â€“h 
    ```
1. Check if the storage share is mounted. If it's not present, there's an issue with mounting the storage share.
1. Check latency or general reachability of the storage mount with the following command:

    ```bash
    tcpping Storageaccount.file.core.windows.net 
    ```

## Best practices

- To avoid potential issues related to latency, place the app and the Azure Storage account in the same Azure region. Note, however, if the app and Azure Storage account are in same Azure region, and if you grant access from App Service IP addresses in the [Azure Storage firewall configuration](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md), then these IP restrictions are not honored.
- The mount path in the container app should be empty. Any content stored at this path is deleted when the Azure Storage is mounted (if you specify a directory under `/home`, for example). If you are migrating files for an existing app, make a backup of the app and its content before you begin.
- Mounting the storage to `/home` is not recommended because it may result in performance bottlenecks for the app. 
- In the Azure Storage account, avoid [regenerating the access key](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage.md) that's used to mount the storage in the app. The storage account contains two different keys. Use a stepwise approach to ensure that the storage mount remains available to the app during key regeneration. For example, assuming that you used **key1** to configure storage mount in your app:
    1. Regenerate **key2**. 
    1. In the storage mount configuration, update the access the key to use the regenerated **key2**.
    1. Regenerate **key1**.
- If you delete an Azure Storage account, container, or share, remove the corresponding storage mount configuration in the app to avoid possible error scenarios. 
- The mounted Azure Storage account can be either Standard or Premium performance tier. Based on the app capacity and throughput requirements, choose the appropriate performance tier for the storage account. See the scalability and performance targets that correspond to the storage type:
    - [For Files](../storage/files/storage-files-scale-targets.md)
    - [For Blobs](../storage/blobs/scalability-targets.md)  
- If your app [scales to multiple instances](../azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-get-started.md), all the instances connect to the same mounted Azure Storage account. To avoid performance bottlenecks and throughput issues, choose the appropriate performance tier for the storage account.  
- It's not recommended to use storage mounts for local databases (such as SQLite) or for any other applications and components that rely on file handles and locks. 
- When using Azure Storage [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) with the app, you need to set the following two app settings:
    - `WEBSITE_DNS_SERVER` = `168.63.129.16`
    - `WEBSITE_VNET_ROUTE_ALL` = `1`
- If you [initiate a storage failover](../storage/common/storage-initiate-account-failover.md) and the storage account is mounted to the app, the mount will fail to connect until you either restart the app or remove and add the Azure Storage mount.
