# Permissions in Azure Security Center

Security Center uses [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md), which provides [built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure.

Security Center assesses the configuration of your resources to identify security issues and vulnerabilities. In Security Center, you only see information related to a resource when you are assigned the role of Owner, Contributor, or Reader for the subscription or the resource's resource group.

In addition to the built-in roles, there are two roles specific to Security Center:

* **Security Reader**: A user that belongs to this role has viewing rights to Security Center. The user can view recommendations, alerts, a security policy, and security states, but cannot make changes.
* **Security Admin**: A user that belongs to this role has the same rights as the Security Reader and can also update the security policy and dismiss alerts and recommendations.

> [!NOTE]
> The security roles, Security Reader and Security Admin, have access only in Security Center. The security roles do not have access to other Azure services such as Storage, Web & Mobile, or Internet of Things.

## Roles and allowed actions

The following table displays roles and allowed actions in Security Center.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you assign the least permissive role needed for users to complete their tasks. For example, assign the Reader role to users who only need to view information about the security health of a resource but not take action, such as applying recommendations or editing policies.

## Next steps
This article explained how Security Center uses Azure RBAC to assign permissions to users and identified the allowed actions for each role.
