## Planned changes

### "Not applicable" resources to be reported as "Compliant" in Azure Policy assessments

**Estimated date for change:** January 2021

Currently, resources that are evaluated for a recommendation and found to be **not applicable** appear in Azure Policy as "Non-compliant". No user actions can change their state to "Compliant". From this planned change, they'll be reported as "Compliant" for improved clarity.
