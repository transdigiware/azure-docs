Azure Security Benchmark is the Microsoft-authored, Azure-specific set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices based on common compliance frameworks. [Learn more about Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/introduction.md).

The following 29 new recommendations will be added to Security Center to increase the coverage of the benchmark.

Preview recommendations don't render a resource unhealthy, and they aren't included in the calculations of your secure score. Remediate them wherever possible, so that when the preview period ends they'll contribute towards your score. Learn more about how to respond to these recommendations in [Remediate recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md).
