# Configure Managed Service offer properties

This page lets you define the categories used to group your offer on Azure Marketplace and the legal contracts that support your offer. This information ensures your Managed Service is displayed correctly on the online store and offered to the right set of customers.

## Categories

Select at least one and up to five categories to place your offer in the appropriate marketplace search areas. Be sure to describe later in the offer description how your offer supports these categories.

## Provide terms and conditions

Under **Legal**, provide your terms and conditions for this offer. Customers will be required to accept them before using the offer. You can also provide the URL where your terms and conditions can be found.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab, **Offer listing**.

## Next step

- Configure [Offer listing](create-managed-service-offer-listing.md)
