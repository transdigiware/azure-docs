# Register and scan an Azure MySQL Database

This article describes how to register and scan an Azure MySQL database.


## Supported Capabilities
- **Full and incremental scans** to capture metadata and classification from Azure MySQL databases.

- **Lineage** between data assets for ADF copy and dataflow activities.

### Known limitations
Purview supports only SQL authentication for Azure MySQL databases.


## Prerequisites

1. Create a new Purview account if you don't already have one.

2. Networking access between your Purview account and the Azure MySQL database.

### Set up authentication for a scan

You will need **username** and **password** for the next steps.

Follow the instructions in [CREATE DATABASES AND USERS](../mysql/howto-create-users.md) to create a login for your Azure MySQL Database.

1. Navigate to your key vault in the Azure portal
1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** and **Value** as the *password* from your Azure SQL Database
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) of type SQL authentication using the **username** and **password** to setup your scan

> [!NOTE]
> * Deleting your scan does not delete assets created from previous Azure MySQL Database scans.
> * The asset will no longer be updated with schema changes if your source table has changed and you re-scan the source table after editing the description in the schema tab of Purview.
