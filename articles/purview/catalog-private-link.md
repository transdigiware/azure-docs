# Use private endpoints for your Azure Purview account

You can use private endpoints for your Azure Purview accounts to allow clients and users on a virtual network (VNet) to securely access the catalog over Azure Private Link. The private endpoint uses an IP address from the virtual network address space for your Azure Purview account. Network traffic between the clients on the virtual network and the Azure Purview account traverses over the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network. This arrangement eliminates exposure from the public internet.

## Create an Azure Purview account with a private endpoint

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then go to your Azure Purview account.

1. Fill in the basic information, and on the **Networking** tab, set the connectivity method to **Private endpoint**. Set up your ingestion private endpoints by providing details for **Subscription**, **Virtual network**, and **Subnet** that you want to pair with your private endpoint.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Create an ingestion private endpoint only if you intend to enable network isolation for end-to-end scan scenarios, for both your Azure and on-premises sources. We currently don't support ingestion private endpoints that work with your AWS sources.

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/create-pe-azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows creating a private endpoint in the Azure portal.":::

1. Optionally, set up a **Private DNS zone** for each ingestion private endpoint.

1. Select **+ Add** to add a private endpoint for your Azure Purview account.

1. On the **Create private endpoint** page, for **Purview sub-resource**, select **account**. Choose your virtual network and subnet, and select the private DNS zone where the DNS will be registered. You can also use your own DNS servers or create DNS records by using host files on your virtual machines.

    :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/create-pe-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Create private endpoint page selections.":::

1. Select **OK**.

1. Select **Review + Create**. On the **Review + Create** page, Azure validates your configuration.

1. When you see the "Validation passed" message, select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/validation-passed.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows that validation passed for account creation.":::

## Create a private endpoint for the Azure Purview web portal

1. Go to the Azure Purview account you created, and under **Settings**, select **Networking** > **Private endpoint connections**.

1. Select **+ Private endpoint** to create a new private endpoint.

    :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/pe-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows creating a portal private endpoint.":::

1. Fill in the basic information.

1. On the **Resource** tab, for **Resource type**, select **Microsoft.Purview/accounts**.

1. For **Resource**, select the newly created Azure Purview account. For **Target sub-resource**, select **portal**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/pe-portal-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows details for the portal private endpoint.":::

1. On the **Configuration** tab, select the virtual network and private DNS zone. Go to the summary page, and select **Create** to create the portal private endpoint.

## Private DNS zone requirements for private endpoints

When you create a private endpoint, the DNS CNAME resource record for Azure Purview is updated to an alias in a subdomain with the prefix `privatelink`. By default, we also create a [private DNS zone](../dns/private-dns-overview.md) that corresponds to the `privatelink` subdomain, with the DNS A resource records for the private endpoints.

When you resolve the Azure Purview endpoint URL from outside the virtual network with the private endpoint, it resolves to the public endpoint of Azure Purview. When resolved from the virtual network hosting the private endpoint, the Azure Purview endpoint URL resolves to the private endpoint's IP address.

As an example, if an Azure Purview account name is 'PurviewA', when it's resolved from outside the virtual network that hosts the private endpoint, it will be:

| Name | Type | Value |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| `PurviewA.purview.azure.com` | CNAME | `PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com` |
| `PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com` | CNAME | \<Purview public endpoint\> |
| \<Purview public endpoint\> | A | \<Purview public IP address\> |
| `Web.purview.azure.com` | CNAME | \<Purview public endpoint\> |

The DNS resource records for PurviewA, when resolved in the virtual network hosting the private endpoint, will be:

| Name | Type | Value |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| `PurviewA.purview.azure.com` | CNAME | `PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com` |
| `PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com` | A | \<private endpoint IP address\> |
| `Web.purview.azure.com` | CNAME | \<private endpoint IP address\> |

<br>

 > [!Important]
 > If you don't use DNS forwarders and instead you manage A records directly in your on-premises DNS servers to resolve the endpoints through their private IP addresses, you might need to create additional A records in your DNS servers.

| Name | Type | Value |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| `PurviewA.Purview.azure.com` | A | \<account private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview> |
| `PurviewA.scan.Purview.azure.com` | A | \<account private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview> |
| `PurviewA.catalog.Purview.azure.com` | A | \<account private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.proxy.purview.azure.com` | A | \<account private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.guardian.purview.azure.com` | A | \<account private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.manifest.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.cdn.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.hub.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.catalog.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.cseo.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.datascan.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.datashare.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.datasource.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.policy.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |
| `PurviewA.sensitivity.prod.ext.web.purview.azure.com` | A | \<portal private endpoint IP address of Azure Purview\> |

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/purview-name-resolution-private-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Purview name resolution from inside CorpNet.":::

It's important to correctly configure your DNS settings to resolve the private endpoint IP address to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the connection string.

If you're using a custom DNS server on your network, clients must be able to resolve the FQDN for the Azure Purview endpoint to the private endpoint IP address. Configure your DNS server to delegate your Private Link subdomain to the private DNS zone for the virtual network. Or, configure the A records for `PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com` with the private endpoint IP address.

## Enable access to Azure Active Directory

> [!NOTE]
> If your VM, VPN gateway, or VNet Peering gateway has public internet access, it can access the Azure Purview portal and the Azure Purview account enabled with private endpoints. For this reason, you don't have to follow the rest of the instructions. If your private network has network security group rules set to deny all public internet traffic, you'll need to add some rules to enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) access. Follow the instructions to do so.

These instructions are provided for accessing Azure Purview securely from an Azure VM. Similar steps must be followed if you're using VPN or other VNet Peering gateways.

1. Go to your VM in the Azure portal, and under **Settings**, select **Networking**. Then select **Outbound port rules** > **Add outbound port rule**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/outbound-rule-add.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding an outbound rule.":::

1. On the **Add outbound security rule** pane:

   1. Under **Destination**, select **Service Tag**.
   1. Under **Destination service tag**, select **AzureActiveDirectory**.
   1. Under **Destination port ranges**, select *.
   1. Under **Action**, select **Allow**.
   1. Under **Priority**, the value should be higher than the rule that denied all internet traffic.
   
   Create the rule.

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/outbound-rule-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding outbound rule details.":::

1. Follow the same steps to create another rule to allow the **AzureResourceManager** service tag. If you need to access the Azure portal, you can also add a rule for the **AzurePortal** service tag.

1. Connect to the VM and open the browser. Go to the browser console by selecting Ctrl+Shift+J, and switch to the network tab to monitor network requests. Enter web.purview.azure.com in the URL box, and try to sign in by using your Azure AD credentials. Sign-in will probably fail, and on the **Network** tab on the console, you can see Azure AD trying to access aadcdn.msauth.net but getting blocked.

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/login-fail.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows sign-in fail details.":::

1. In this case, open a command prompt on the VM, ping aadcdn.msauth.net, get its IP, and then add an outbound port rule for the IP in the VM's network security rules. Set the **Destination** to **IP Addresses** and set **Destination IP addresses** to the aadcdn IP. Because of Azure Load Balancer and Azure Traffic Manager, the Azure AD Content Delivery Network IP might be dynamic. After you get its IP, it's better to add it into the VM's host file to force the browser to visit that IP to get the Azure AD Content Delivery Network.

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/ping.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the test ping.":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/aadcdn-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure A D Content Delivery Network rule.":::

1. After the new rule is created, go back to the VM and try to sign in by using your Azure AD credentials again. If sign-in succeeds, then the Azure Purview portal is ready to use. But in some cases, Azure AD redirects to other domains to sign in based on a customer's account type. For example, for a live.com account, Azure AD redirects to live.com to sign in, and then those requests are blocked again. For Microsoft employee accounts, Azure AD accesses msft.sts.microsoft.com for sign-in information.

   Check the networking requests on the browser **Networking** tab to see which domain's requests are getting blocked, redo the previous step to get its IP, and add outbound port rules in the network security group to allow requests for that IP. If possible, add the URL and IP to the VM's host file to fix the DNS resolution. If you know the exact sign-in domain's IP ranges, you can also directly add them into networking rules.

1. Now your Azure AD sign-in should be successful. The Azure Purview portal will load successfully, but listing all the Azure Purview accounts won't work because it can only access a specific Azure Purview account. Enter `web.purview.azure.com/resource/{PurviewAccountName}` to directly visit the Azure Purview account that you successfully set up a private endpoint for.

## Ingestion private endpoints and scanning sources

You need to scan sources in private networks, virtual networks, and behind private endpoints. To ensure network isolation for your metadata flowing from the source that's being scanned to the Azure Purview DataMap:

1. Enable an ingestion private endpoint by following steps in [this section](#create-an-ingestion-private-endpoint).

1. Scan the source by using a self-hosted integration runtime (IR).

    1. All on-premises source types like Azure SQL Server, Oracle, SAP, and others are currently supported only via self-hosted IR-based scans. The self-hosted IR must run within your private network and then be peered with your virtual network in Azure. Follow [these steps](#create-an-ingestion-private-endpoint) to enable your Azure virtual network on your ingestion private endpoint.

    2. For all Azure source types like Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database, you must explicitly choose to run the scan by using a self-hosted IR to ensure network isolation. Follow the steps in [Create and manage a self-hosted integration runtime](manage-integration-runtimes.md) to set up a self-hosted IR. Then set up your scan on the Azure source by choosing that self-hosted IR in the **Connect via integration runtime** dropdown list to ensure network isolation.
    
       :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/shir-for-azure.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows running an Azure scan by using self-hosted IR.":::

> [!NOTE]
> When you use a private endpoint for ingestion, you can use an Azure integration runtime for scanning only for the following data sources:
>
> - Azure Blob Storage
> - Azure Data Lake Gen 2
>
> For other data sources, a self-hosted IR is required. We currently don't support the MSI credential method when you scan your Azure sources by using a self-hosted IR. You must use one of the other supported credential methods for that Azure source.

## Enable a private endpoint on existing Azure Purview accounts

There are two ways you can add Azure Purview private endpoints after you create your Azure Purview account:

- Use the Azure portal (Azure Purview account).
- Use the Private Link Center.

### Use the Azure portal (Azure Purview account)

1. Go to the Azure Purview account from the Azure portal, and under **Settings** > **Networking**, select **Private endpoint connections**.

1. Select **+ Private endpoint** to create a new private endpoint.

1. Fill in the basic information.

1. On the **Resource** tab, for **Resource type**, select **Microsoft.Purview/accounts**.

1. For **Resource**, select the Azure Purview account, and for **Target sub-resource**, select **account**.

1. On the **Configuration** tab, select the virtual network and private DNS zone. Go to the summary page, and select **Create** to create the portal private endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> Follow the same steps when you select **portal** for **Target sub-resource**.

#### Create an ingestion private endpoint

1. Go to the Azure Purview account from the Azure portal, and under **Settings** > **Networking**, select **Private endpoint connections**.

1. Go to the **Ingestion private endpoint connections** tab, and select **+ New** to create a new ingestion private endpoint.

1. Fill in the basic information and virtual network details.

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/ingestion-pe-fill-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows filling in private endpoint details.":::

1. Select **Create** to finish the setup.

> [!NOTE]
> Ingestion private endpoints can be created only via the Azure Purview portal experience described in the preceding steps. They can't be created from the Private Link Center.

### Use the Private Link Center

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search bar at the top of the page, search for **private link** and go to the **Private Link** pane by selecting the first option.

1. Select **+ Add**, and fill in the basic details.

   :::image type="content" source="media/catalog-private-link/private-link-center.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows creating private endpoints from the Private Link Center.":::

1. For **Resource**, select the already created Azure Purview account. For **Target sub-resource**, select **account**.

1. On the **Configuration** tab, select the virtual network and private DNS zone. Go to the summary page, and select **Create** to create the account private endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> Follow the same steps when you select **portal** for **Target sub-resource**.

## Firewalls to restrict public access

To cut off access to the Azure Purview account completely from the public internet, follow these steps. This setting applies to both private endpoint and ingestion private endpoint connections.

1. Go to the Azure Purview account from the Azure portal, and under **Settings** > **Networking**, select **Private endpoint connections**.

1. Go to the **Firewall** tab, and ensure that the toggle is set to **Deny**.
