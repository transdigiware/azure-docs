# Register and Scan Looker(Preview)

This article outlines how to register a Looker Server in Purview and set
up a scan.

## Supported capabilities

The Looker source supports Full scan to extract metadata from a Looker
server. It imported metadata from a Looker server, including database
connections, LookML Models and associated reports (Looks and
Dashboards). This data source also fetches Lineage between data assets.

> [!Note]
> Looker as a source is currently supported in private preview. Register this source and setup your scans in your non-production Purview accounts and provide us your feedback.

## Prerequisites

1.  Set up the latest [self-hosted integration
    runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717).
    For more information, seeÂ 
    [Create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime](../data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md).

2.  Make sure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) is installed on your virtual machine where self-hosted integration
    runtime is installed.

3.  Make sure \"Visual C++ Redistributable 2012 Update 4\" is installed
    on the VM where self-hosted integration runtime is running. If you
    don\'t have it installed, download it from
    [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

4.  Supported Looker server version is 7.2

## Setting up authentication for a scan

An API3 key is required to connect to the Looker server. The API3 key
consists in a public client_id and a private client_secret and follows
an OAuth2 authentication pattern.

## Register a Looker server

To register a new Looker server in your data catalog, do the following:

1. Navigate to your Purview account.
2. Select **Sources** on the left navigation.
3. Select **Register.**
4. On Register sources, select **Looker**. Select **Continue.**

On the Register sources (Looker) screen, do the following:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the
    Catalog.

2. Enter the Looker API URL in the **Server API URL** field. The
    default port for API requests is port 19999. Also, all Looker API
    endpoints require an HTTPS connection. For example,
    https://azurepurview.cloud.looker.com

3. Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

4. Finish to register the data source.

    to setup a self-hosted integration runtime

2. Navigate to **Sources**.

3. Select the registered **Looker** server.

4. Select **+ New scan**.

    c.  **Server API URL** is auto populated based on the value entered
        during registration.

    d.  **Credential:** While configuring Looker credential, make sure
        to:

    - Select **Basic Authentication** as the Authentication method
    - Provide your Looker API3 key's client ID in the User name field
    - Save your Looker API3 key's client secret in the key vault's secret.

    **Note:** To access client ID and client secret, navigate to Looker -\>Admin -\> Users -\> Click on **Edit** on an user -\> Click on **EditKeys** -\> Use the Client ID and Client Secret or create a new one.
