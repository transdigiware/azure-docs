# Tutorial: Check data source readiness at scale (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Purview is currently in preview. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta or preview or are otherwise not yet released for general availability.

To scan data sources, Azure Purview requires access to them. It uses credentials to obtain this access. A *credential* is the authentication information that Azure Purview can use to authenticate to your registered data sources. There are a few ways to set up the credentials for Azure Purview, including: 
- The managed identity assigned to the Azure Purview account.
- Secrets stored in Azure Key Vault. 
- Service principals.

In this two-part tutorial series, we'll help you verify and configure required Azure role assignments and network access for various Azure data sources across your Azure subscriptions at scale. You can then register and scan your Azure data sources in Azure Purview. 

Run the [Azure Purview data sources readiness checklist](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/tree/master/Data-Source-Readiness) script after you deploy your Azure Purview account and before you register and scan your Azure data sources. 

In part 1 of this tutorial series, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Locate your data sources and prepare a list of data source subscriptions.
> * Run the readiness checklist script to find any missing role-based access control (RBAC) or network configurations across your data sources in Azure.
> * In the output report, review missing network configurations and role assignments required by Azure Purview Managed Identity (MSI). 
> * Share the report with data Azure subscription owners so they can take suggested actions.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscriptions where your data sources are located. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
* An [Azure Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).
* An Azure Key Vault resource in each subscription that has data sources like Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics, or Azure SQL Managed Instance.
* The [Azure Purview data sources readiness checklist](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/tree/master/Data-Source-Readiness) script.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Purview data sources readiness checklist is available only for Windows.
> This readiness checklist script is currently supported for Azure Purview MSI.

## Prepare Azure subscriptions list for data sources

Before running the script, create a .csv file (for example, C:\temp\Subscriptions.csv) with four columns:

|Column name|Description|Example|
|----|----|----|
|`SubscriptionId`|Azure subscription IDs for your data sources.|12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-1234567890ab|
|`KeyVaultName`|Name of existing key vault thatâ€™s deployed in the data source subscription.|ContosoDevKeyVault|
|`SecretNameSQLUserName`|Name of an existing Azure Key Vault secret that contains an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user name that can sign in to Azure Synapse, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance by using Azure AD authentication.|ContosoDevSQLAdmin|
|`SecretNameSQLPassword`|Name of an existing Azure Key Vault secret that contains an Azure AD user password that can sign in to Azure Synapse, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance by using Azure AD authentication.|ContosoDevSQLPassword|
   

**Sample .csv file:**
    
:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-data-sources-readiness/subscriptions-input.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a sample subscription list." lightbox="./media/tutorial-data-sources-readiness/subscriptions-input.png":::

> [!NOTE] 
> You can update the file name and path in the code, if you need to.



## Run the script and install the required PowerShell modules 

Follow these steps to run the script from your Windows computer:

1. [Download the Azure Purview data sources readiness checklist](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/tree/master/Data-Source-Readiness) script to the location of your choice.

2. On your computer, enter **PowerShell** in the search box on the Windows taskbar. In the search list, right-click **Windows PowerShell** and then select **Run as administrator**.

3. In the PowerShell window, enter the following command. (Replace `<path-to-script>` with the folder path of the extracted script file.)

   ```powershell
   dir -Path <path-to-script> | Unblock-File
   ```

4. Enter the following command to install the Azure cmdlets:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
6. If you see the prompt *NuGet provider is required to continue*, enter **Y**, and then select **Enter**.

7. If you see the prompt *Untrusted repository*, enter **A**, and then select **Enter**.

5. Repeat the previous steps to install the `Az.Synapse` and `AzureAD` modules.

It might take up to a minute for PowerShell to install the required modules.


## Collect other data needed to run the script

Before you run the PowerShell script to verify the readiness of data source subscriptions, obtain the values of the following arguments to use in the scripts:

- `AzureDataType`: Choose any of the following options as your data-source type to check the readiness for the data type across your subscriptions: 
    
    - `BlobStorage`

    - `AzureSQLMI`

    - `AzureSQLDB`
    
    - `ADLSGen2`
    
    - `ADLSGen1`
    
    - `Synapse`
    
    - `All`

- `PurviewAccount`: Your existing Azure Purview account resource name.

- `PurviewSub`: Subscription ID where the Azure Purview account is deployed.

## Verify your permissions

Make sure your user has the following roles and permissions:

Role or permission | Scope |
|-------|--------|
| **Global Reader** | Azure AD tenant |
| **Reader** | Azure subscriptions where your Azure data sources are located |
| **Reader** | Subscription where your Azure Purview account was created |
| **SQL Admin** (Azure AD Authentication) | Azure Synapse dedicated pools, Azure SQL Database instances, Azure SQL managed instances |
| Access to your Azure key vault | Access to get/list key vault's secret or Azure Key Vault secret user |  


## Run the client-side readiness script

Run the script by completing these steps:

1. Use the following command to go to the script's folder. Replace `<path-to-script>` with the folder path of the extracted file.

   ```powershell
   cd <path-to-script>
   ```

2. Run the following command to set the execution policy for the local computer. Enter **A** for *Yes to All* when you're prompted to change the execution policy.

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
   ```

3. Run the script with the following parameters. Replace the `DataType`, `PurviewName`, and `SubscriptionID` placeholders.

   ```powershell
   .\purview-data-sources-readiness-checklist.ps1 -AzureDataType <DataType> -PurviewAccount <PurviewName> -PurviewSub <SubscriptionID>
   ```

   When you run the command, a pop-up window might appear twice prompting you to sign in to Azure and Azure AD by using your Azure Active Directory credentials.


It can take several minutes to create the report, depending on the number of Azure subscriptions and resources in the environment. 

After the process completes, review the output report, which demonstrates the detected missing configurations in your Azure subscriptions or resources. The results can appear as _Passed_, _Not Passed_, or _Awareness_. You can share the results with the corresponding subscription admins in your organization so they can configure the required settings.
