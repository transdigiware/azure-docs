# Customer intent: As a data steward or catalog administrator, I need to onboard Azure data sources at scale before I register and scan them.

# Tutorial: Configure access to data sources for Azure Purview MSI at scale (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Purview is currently in preview. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta or preview or are otherwise not yet released for general availability.

To scan data sources, Azure Purview requires access to them. This tutorial is intended for Azure subscription owners and Azure Purview Data Source Administrators. It will help you identify required access and set up required authentication and network rules for Azure Purview across Azure data sources.

In part 2 of this tutorial series, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Locate your data sources and prepare a list of data source subscriptions.
> * Run a script to configure any missing role-based access control (RBAC) or required network configurations across your data sources in Azure.
> * Review the output report.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscriptions where your data sources are located. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
* An [Azure Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).
* An Azure Key Vault resource in each subscription that has data sources like Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics, or Azure SQL Managed Instance.
* The [Azure Purview MSI Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/tree/master/Data-Source-MSI-Configuration) script.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Purview MSI Configuration script is available only for Windows.
> This script is currently supported for Azure Purview Managed Identity (MSI).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We strongly recommend that you test and verify all the changes the script performs in your Azure environment before you deploy it into your production environment.

## Prepare Azure subscriptions list for data sources 

Before you run the script, create a .csv file (for example, "C:\temp\Subscriptions.csv) with four columns:
   
|Column name|Description|Example|
|----|----|----|
|`SubscriptionId`|Azure subscription IDs for your data sources.|12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-1234567890ab|
|`KeyVaultName`|Name of existing key vault thatâ€™s deployed in the data source subscription.|ContosoDevKeyVault|
|`SecretNameSQLUserName`|Name of an existing Azure Key Vault secret that contains an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user name that can sign in to Azure Synapse, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance by using Azure AD authentication.|ContosoDevSQLAdmin|
|`SecretNameSQLPassword`|Name of an existing Azure Key Vault secret that contains an Azure AD user password that can sign in to Azure Synapse, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance by using Azure AD authentication.|ContosoDevSQLPassword|
   


**Sample .csv file:**
    
:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-data-sources-readiness/subscriptions-input.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a sample subscription list." lightbox="./media/tutorial-data-sources-readiness/subscriptions-input.png":::

> [!NOTE] 
> You can update the file name and path in the code, if you need to.


## Run the script and install the required PowerShell modules 

Follow these steps to run the script from your Windows computer:

1. [Download Azure Purview MSI Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/tree/master/Data-Source-MSI-Configuration) script to the location of your choice.

2. On your computer, enter **PowerShell** in the search box on the Windows taskbar. In the search list, right-click **Windows PowerShell** and then select **Run as administrator**.

3. In the PowerShell window, enter the following command. (Replace `<path-to-script>` with the folder path of the extracted script file.)

   ```powershell
   dir -Path <path-to-script> | Unblock-File
   ```

4. Enter the following command to install the Azure cmdlets:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
5. If you see the prompt *NuGet provider is required to continue*, enter **Y**, and then select **Enter**.

6. If you see the prompt *Untrusted repository*, enter **A**, and then select **Enter**.

7. Repeat the previous steps to install the `Az.Synapse` and `AzureAD` modules.

It might take up to a minute for PowerShell to install the required modules.


## Collect other data needed to run the script

Before you run the PowerShell script to verify the readiness of data source subscriptions, obtain the values of the following arguments to use in the scripts:

- `AzureDataType`: Choose any of the following options as your data-source type to check the readiness for the data type across your subscriptions: 
    
    - `BlobStorage`

    - `AzureSQLMI`

    - `AzureSQLDB`
    
    - `ADLSGen2`
    
    - `ADLSGen1`
    
    - `Synapse`
    
    - `All`

- `PurviewAccount`: Your existing Azure Purview account resource name.

- `PurviewSub`: Subscription ID where the Azure Purview account is deployed.

## Verify your permissions

Make sure your user has the following roles and permissions:

At a minimum, you need the following permissions to run the script in your Azure environment:

Role | Scope | Why is it needed? |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Global Reader** | Azure AD tenant | To read Azure SQL Admin user group membership and Azure Purview MSI |
| **Global Administrator** | Azure AD tenant | To assign the **Directory Reader** role to Azure SQL managed instances |
| **Contributor** | Subscription or resource group where your Azure Purview account is created | To read the Azure Purview account resource and create a Key Vault resource and secret |
| **Owner or User Access Administrator** | Management group or subscription where your Azure data sources are located | To assign RBAC |
| **Contributor** | Management group or subscription where your Azure data sources are located | To set up network configuration |
| **SQL Admin** (Azure AD Authentication) | Azure SQL Server instances or Azure SQL managed instances | To assign the **db_datareader** role to Azure Purview |
| Access to your Azure key vault | Access to get/list Key Vault secret for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or Azure Synapse authentication |  


## Run the client-side readiness script

Run the script by completing these steps:

1. Use the following command to go to the script's folder. Replace `<path-to-script>` with the folder path of the extracted file.

   ```powershell
   cd <path-to-script>
   ```

2. Run the following command to set the execution policy for the local computer. Enter **A** for *Yes to All* when you're prompted to change the execution policy.

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
   ```

3. Run the script with the following parameters. Replace the `DataType`, `PurviewName`, and `SubscriptionID` placeholders.

   ```powershell
   .\purview-msi-configuration.ps1 -AzureDataType <DataType> -PurviewAccount <PurviewName> -PurviewSub <SubscriptionID>
   ```

   When you run the command, a pop-up window might appear twice prompting you to sign in to Azure and Azure AD by using your Azure Active Directory credentials.

It can take several minutes to create the report, depending on the number of Azure subscriptions and resources in the environment. 

You might be prompted to sign in to your Azure SQL Server instances if the credentials in the key vault don't match. You can provide the credentials or select **Enter** to skip the specific server. 

After the process completes, view the output report to review the changes.
