# Register and scan an Azure database for PostgreSQL

This article describes how to register and scan an Azure database for PostgreSQL.


## Supported capabilities
- **Full and incremental scans** to capture metadata and classification from Azure databases for PostgreSQL.

- **Lineage** between data assets for ADF copy and dataflow activities.

### Known limitations

Purview supports only SQL authentication for Azure database for PostgreSQL.


## Prerequisites

1. Create a new Purview account if you don't already have one.

2. Networking access between your Purview account and the Azure database for PostgreSQL.

#### SQL authentication for an Azure database for PostgreSQL

Connecting to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL database requires the fully qualified server name and login credentials. You can follow the instructions in [CONNECT AND QUERY](/articles/postgresql/connect-python.md) to create a login for your Azure database for PostgreSQL if you don't have this available. You will need **username** and **password** for the next steps.

1. Navigate to your key vault in the Azure portal
1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** and **Value** as the *password* from your Azure PostgreSQL Database
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) of type SQL authentication using the **username** and **password** to setup your scan

1. You can scope your scan to specific folders or subfolders by choosing the appropriate items in the list.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-postgresql/04-scope-scan.png" alt-text="Scope your scan":::

1. Then select a scan rule set. You can choose between the system default, existing custom rule sets, or create a new rule set inline.

1. Review your scan and select **Save and run**.

> [!NOTE]
> * Deleting your scan does not delete catalog assets created from previous scans.
> * The asset will no longer be updated with schema changes if your source table has changed and you re-scan the source table after editing the description in the schema tab of Purview.
