# Register and scan Azure Files

## Supported capabilities

Azure Files supports full and incremental scans to capture the metadata and classifications, based on system default and custom classification rules.

## Prerequisites

- Before registering data sources, create an Azure Purview account. For more information on creating a Purview account, see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).
- You need to be a Data Source Administrator to set up and schedule scans, see [Catalog Permissions](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

## Setting up authentication for a scan

Currently there's only one way to set up authentication for Azure file storage:

- Account Key

### Account Key

When authentication method selected is **Account Key**, you need to get your access key and store in the key vault:

1. Navigate to your storage account
1. Select **Settings > Access keys**
1. Copy your *key* and save it somewhere for the next steps
1. Navigate to your key vault
1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** and **Value** as the *key* from your storage account
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault isn't connected to Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-azure-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the key to set up your scan

## Register an Azure Files storage account

To register a new Azure Files account in your data catalog, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Purview Data Studio.
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register**
1. On **Register sources**, select **Azure Files**
1. Select **Continue**
