# Install and provision Azure IoT Edge for Linux on a Windows device

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-201806](../../includes/iot-edge-version-201806.md)]

The Azure IoT Edge runtime is what turns a device into an IoT Edge device. The runtime can be deployed on devices from PC class to industrial servers. Once a device is configured with the IoT Edge runtime, you can start deploying business logic to it from the cloud. To learn more, see [Understand the Azure IoT Edge runtime and its architecture](iot-edge-runtime.md).

Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows allows you to install IoT Edge on Linux virtual machines that run on Windows devices. The Linux version of Azure IoT Edge and any Linux modules deployed with it run on the virtual machine. From there, Windows applications and code and the IoT Edge runtime and modules can freely interact with each other.

This article lists the steps to set up IoT Edge on a Windows device. These steps deploy a Linux virtual machine that contains the IoT Edge runtime to run on your Windows device, then provision the device with its IoT Hub device identity.

>[!NOTE]
>IoT Edge for Linux on Windows is the recommended experience for using Azure IoT Edge in a Windows environment. However, Windows containers are still available. If you prefer to use Windows containers, see [Install and manage Azure IoT Edge with Windows containers](how-to-install-iot-edge-windows-on-windows.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with a valid subscription. If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide.md#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

* A free or standard tier [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in Azure.

* A Windows device with the following minimum system requirements:

  * Windows 10 Version 1809 or later; build 17763 or later
  * Professional, Enterprise, or Server editions
  * Minimum Free Memory: 1 GB
  * Minimum Free Disk Space: 10 GB
  * Virtualization support
    * On Windows 10, enable Hyper-V. For more information, see [Install Hyper-V on Windows 10](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
    * On Windows Server, install the Hyper-V role and create a default network switch. For more information, see [Nested virtualization for Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](nested-virtualization.md).
    * On a virtual machine, configure nested virtualization. For more information, see [nested virtualization](nested-virtualization.md).

* If you want to install and manage IoT Edge device using Windows Admin Center, make sure you have access to Windows Admin Center and have the Azure IoT Edge extension installed:

   1. Download and run the [Windows Admin Center installer](https://aka.ms/wacdownload). Follow the install wizard prompts to install Windows Admin Center.

   1. Once installed, use a supported browser to open Windows Admin Center. Supported browsers include Microsoft Edge (Windows 10, version 1709 or later), Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge Insider.

   1. On the first use of Windows Admin Center, you will be prompted to select a certificate to use. Select **Windows Admin Center Client** as your certificate.

   1. Install the Azure IoT Edge extension. Select the gear icon in the top right of the Windows Admin Center dashboard.

      ![Select the gear icon in the top right of the dashboard to access the settings.](./media/how-to-install-iot-edge-on-windows/select-gear-icon.png)

   1. On the **Settings** menu, under **Gateway**, select **Extensions**.

   1. On the **Available extensions** tab, find **Azure IoT Edge** in the list of extensions. Choose it, and select the **Install** prompt above the list of extensions.

## Create a new deployment

Deploy Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on your target device.

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Install IoT Edge for Linux on Windows onto your target device if you have not already.

> [!NOTE]
> The following PowerShell process outlines how to deploy IoT Edge for Linux on Windows onto the local device. To deploy to a remote target device using PowerShell, you can use [Remote PowerShell](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_remote) to establish a connection to a remote device and run these commands remotely on that device.

1. In an elevated PowerShell session, run each of the following commands to download IoT Edge for Linux on Windows.

   ```powershell
   $msiPath = $([io.Path]::Combine($env:TEMP, 'AzureIoTEdge.msi'))
   $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
   Invoke-WebRequest "https://aka.ms/AzEflowMSI" -OutFile $msiPath
   ```

1. Install IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on your device.

   ```powershell
   Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/i","$([io.Path]::Combine($env:TEMP, 'AzureIoTEdge.msi'))","/qn"
   ```

   You can specify custom IoT Edge for Linux on Windows installation and VHDX directories by adding `INSTALLDIR="<FULLY_QUALIFIED_PATH>"` and `VHDXDIR="<FULLY_QUALIFIED_PATH>"` parameters to the install command.

1. Set the execution policy on the target device to `AllSigned` if it is not already. You can check the current execution policy in an elevated PowerShell prompt using:

   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
   ```

   If the execution policy of `local machine` is not `AllSigned`, you can set the execution policy using:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Force
   ```

1. Create the IoT Edge for Linux on Windows deployment.

   ```powershell
   Deploy-Eflow
   ```

   The `Deploy-Eflow` command takes optional parameters that help you customize your deployment.

   You can assign a GPU to your deployment to enable GPU-accelerated Linux modules. To gain access to these features, you will need to install the prerequisites detailed in [GPU acceleration for Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](gpu-acceleration.md).

   To use a GPU passthrough, you will need add the **gpuName**, **gpuPassthroughType**, and **gpuCount** parameters to your `Deploy-Eflow` command. For information about all the optional parameters available, see [PowerShell functions for IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](reference-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows-functions.md#deploy-eflow).

   >[!WARNING]
   >Enabling hardware device passthrough may increase security risks. Microsoft recommends a device mitigation driver from your GPU's vendor, when applicable. For more information, see [Deploy graphics devices using discrete device assignment](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/deploy/deploying-graphics-devices-using-dda).



1. Enter 'Y' to accept the license terms.

1. Enter 'O' or 'R' to toggle **Optional diagnostic data** on or off, depending on your preference.

1. Once the deployment is complete, the PowerShell window reports **Deployment successful**.

   ![A successful deployment will say 'Deployment successful' at the end of the messages](./media/how-to-install-iot-edge-on-windows/successful-powershell-deployment-2.png)

Once your deployment is complete, you are ready to provision your device.

# [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windowsadmincenter)

>[!NOTE]
>The Azure IoT Edge extension for Windows Admin Center is currently in [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). Installation and management processes may be different than for generally available features.

On the Windows Admin Center start page, under the list of connections, you will see a local host connection representing the PC where you are running Windows Admin Center. Any additional servers, PCs, or clusters that you manage will also show up here.

You can use Windows Admin Center to install and manage Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on either your local device or remote managed devices. In this guide, the local host connection will serve as the target device for the deployment of Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows.

If you want to deploy to a remote target device instead of your local device and you do not see your desired target device in the list, follow the [instructions to add your device.](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/use/get-started#connecting-to-managed-nodes-and-clusters).

   ![Initial Windows Admin Center dashboard with target device listed](./media/how-to-install-iot-edge-on-windows/windows-admin-center-initial-dashboard.png)

   ![Select your device to verify it is supported](./media/how-to-install-iot-edge-on-windows/evaluate-supported-device.png)

1. On the **2.2 Settings** tab, review the configuration settings of your deployment.

   >[!NOTE]
   >IoT Edge for Linux on Windows uses a default switch, which assigns the Linux virtual machine an internal IP address. This internal IP address cannot be reached from outside the Windows machine. You can connect to the virtual machine locally while logged onto the Windows machine.
   >
   >If you are using Windows Server, set up a default switch before deploying IoT Edge for Linux on Windows.

   You can assign a GPU to your deployment to enable GPU-accelerated Linux modules. To gain access to these features, you will need to install the prerequisites detailed in [GPU acceleration for Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](gpu-acceleration.md). If you are only installing these prerequisites at this point in the deployment process, you will need to start again from the beginning.

   There are two options for GPU passthrough available: **Direct Device Assignment (DDA)** and **GPU Paravirtualization (GPU-PV)**, depending on the GPU adaptor you assign to your deployment. Examples of each method are shown below.

   For the direct device assignment method, select the number of GPU processors to allocate to your Linux virtual machine.

   ![Configuration settings with a direct device assignment GPU enabled.](./media/how-to-install-iot-edge-on-windows/gpu-passthrough-direct-device-assignment.png)

   For the paravirtualization method, no additional settings are needed.

   ![Configuration settings with a paravirtualization GPU enabled.](./media/how-to-install-iot-edge-on-windows/gpu-passthrough-paravirtualization.png)

   >[!WARNING]
   >Enabling hardware device passthrough may increase security risks. Microsoft recommends a device mitigation driver from your GPU's vendor, when applicable. For more information, see [Deploy graphics devices using discrete device assignment](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/deploy/deploying-graphics-devices-using-dda).

   Once you are satisfied with the settings, select **Next**.

1. On the **2.3 Deployment** tab, you can watch the progress of the deployment. The full process includes downloading the Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows package, installing the package, configuring the host device, and setting up the Linux virtual machine. This process may take several minutes to complete. A successful deployment is pictured below.

   ![A successful deployment will show each step with a green check mark and a 'Complete' label](./media/how-to-install-iot-edge-on-windows/successful-deployment.png)

Once your deployment is complete, you are ready to provision your device. Select **Next: Connect** to proceed to the **3. Connect** tab, which handles Azure IoT Edge device provisioning.
