# Call Recording API Quickstart

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview](../../includes/public-preview-include-document.md)]

This quickstart gets you started recording voice and video calls. This quickstart assumes you've already used the [Calling client SDK](get-started-with-video-calling.md) to build the end-user calling experience. Using the **Calling Server APIs and SDKs** you can enable and manage recordings.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
