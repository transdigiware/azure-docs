## Object model

The following classes handle some of the major features of the recording Server apps of Java.

| Name                                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CallingServerClientBuilder | This class is used to create instance of CallingServerClient.|
| CallingServerClient | This class is needed for the calling functionality. You obtain an instance via CallingServerClientBuilder and use it to start/hangup a call, play/cancel audio and add/remove participants |

## Getting serverCallId as a requirement for call recording server APIs

> [!NOTE]
> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment. To use this API please use 'beta' release of ACS Calling Web SDK. A client sample with recording flows is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-web-calling-hero/tree/public-preview).


Call recording is an extended feature of the core Call API. You first need to obtain the recording feature API object:

```JavaScript
const callRecordingApi = call.api(Features.Recording);
```

Subscribe to recording changes:

```JavaScript
const isRecordingActiveChangedHandler = () => {
  console.log(callRecordingApi.isRecordingActive);
};

callRecordingApi.on('isRecordingActiveChanged', isRecordingActiveChangedHandler);
```

Get server call ID which can be used to start/stop/pause/resume recording sessions:

Once the call is connected use the `getServerCallId` method to get the server call ID.

```JavaScript
callAgent.on('callsUpdated', (e: { added: Call[]; removed: Call[] }): void => {
    e.added.forEach((addedCall) => {
        addedCall.on('stateChanged', (): void => {
            if (addedCall.state === 'Connected') {
                addedCall.info.getServerCallId().then(result => {
                    dispatch(setServerCallId(result));
                }).catch(err => {
                    console.log(err);
                });
            }
        });
    });
});
```

## Create a calling server client

To create a calling server client, you'll use your Communication Services connection string and pass it to calling server client object.

```java
NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder httpClientBuilder = new NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder();
CallingServerClientBuilder builder = new CallingServerClientBuilder().httpClient(httpClientBuilder.build())
 .connectionString(connectionString);
 callingServerClient = builder.buildClient();
```

## Start recording session using 'startRecordingWithResponse' server API

Use the server call ID received during initiation of the call.

```java
URI recordingStateCallbackUri = new URI("<CallbackUri>");

Response<StartCallRecordingResult> response = this.callingServerClient.initializeServerCall("<serverCallId>")
.startRecordingWithResponse(String.valueOf(recordingStateCallbackUri),null);
```
The `startRecordingWithResponse` API response contains the recording ID of the recording session.

## Stop recording session using 'stopRecordingWithResponse' server API

Use the recording ID received in response of `startRecordingWithResponse`.

```java
Response<Void> response = this.callingServerClient.initializeServerCall(serverCallId)
.stopRecordingWithResponse(recordingId, null);
```

## Pause recording session using 'pauseRecordingWithResponse' server API

Use the recording ID received in response of  `startRecordingWithResponse`.

```java
Response<Void> response = this.callingServerClient.initializeServerCall(serverCallId)
.pauseRecordingWithResponse(recordingId, null);
```

## Resume recording session using 'resumeRecordingWithResponse' server API

Use the recording ID received in response of  `startRecordingWithResponse`.

```java
Response<Void> response = this.callingServerClient.initializeServerCall(serverCallId)
.resumeRecordingWithResponse(serverCallId, null);
```

## Download recording File using 'downloadToWithResponse' server API

Use an [Azure Event Grid](../../../../../event-grid/overview.md) web hook or other triggered action should be used to notify your services when the recorded media is ready for download.

Below is an example of the event schema.

```
{
    "id": string, // Unique guid for event
    "topic": string, // Azure Communication Services resource id
    "subject": string, // /recording/call/{call-id}
    "data": {
        "recordingStorageInfo": {
            "recordingChunks": [
                {
                    "documentId": string, // Document id for retrieving from AMS storage
                    "contentLocation": string, //ACS URL where the content is located
                    "metadataLocation": string, // ACS URL where the metadata for this chunk is located
                    "index": int, // Index providing ordering for this chunk in the entire recording
                    "endReason": string, // Reason for chunk ending: "SessionEnded", "ChunkMaximumSizeExceeded”, etc.
                }
            ]
        },
        "recordingStartTime": string, // ISO 8601 date time for the start of the recording
        "recordingDurationMs": int, // Duration of recording in milliseconds
        "sessionEndReason": string // Reason for call ending: "CallEnded", "InitiatorLeft”, etc.
    },
    "eventType": string, // "Microsoft.Communication.RecordingFileStatusUpdated"
    "dataVersion": string, // "1.0"
    "metadataVersion": string, // "1"
    "eventTime": string // ISO 8601 date time for when the event was created
}
```
Use `downloadToWithResponse` method of `CallingServerClient` class for downloading the recorded media. Following are the supported parameters for `downloadToWithResponse` method:

- `contentLocation`: ACS URL where the content is located.
- `destinationPath` : File location.
- `parallelDownloadOptionss`: An optional ParallelDownloadOptions object to modify how the - parallel download will work.
- `overwrite`: True to overwrite the file if it exists.
- `context`: A Context representing the request context.

```Java
Boolean overwrite = true;
ParallelDownloadOptions parallelDownloadOptions = null;
Context context = null;

String filePath = String.format(".\\%s.%s", documentId, fileType);
Path destinationPath = Paths.get(filePath);

Response<Void> downloadResponse = callingServerClient.downloadToWithResponse(contentLocation, destinationPath, parallelDownloadOptions, overwrite, context);
```
The content location and document IDs for the recording files can be fetched from the `contentLocation` and `documentId` fields respectively, for each `recordingChunk`.
