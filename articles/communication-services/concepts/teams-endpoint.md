# Build a custom Teams endpoint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable or disable the custom Teams endpoint experience, [complete and submit this form](https://forms.office.com/r/B8p5KqCH19).

You can use Azure Communication Services to build custom Teams endpoints to communicate with the Microsoft Teams client or other custom Teams endpoints. With a custom Teams endpoint, you can customize a voice, video, chat, and screen-sharing experience for Teams users.

You can use the Azure Communication Services Identity SDK to exchange Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user tokens for Teams access tokens. The diagrams in the next sections demonstrate multitenant use cases, where fictional company Fabrikam is the customer of fictional company Contoso.

## Calling 

Voice, video, and screen-sharing capabilities are provided via Azure Communication Services Calling SDKs. The following diagram shows an overview of the process you'll follow as you integrate your calling experiences with custom Teams endpoints.

## Chat

Optionally, you can also use custom Teams endpoints to integrate chat capabilities by using Graph APIs. For more information about the Graph API, see the [chat resource type](/graph/api/channel-post-messages) documentation.
