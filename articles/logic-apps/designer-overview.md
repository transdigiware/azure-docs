# About the workflow designer in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps

When you work with Azure Logic Apps in the Azure portal, you can edit your [*workflows*](logic-apps-overview.md#workflow) visually or programmatically. After you open a [*logic app* resource](logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app) in the portal, on the resource menu under **Developer**, you can select between [**Code** view](#code-view) and **Designer** view. When you want to visually develop, edit, and run your workflow, select the designer view. You can switch between the designer view and code view at any time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the latest version of the designer is available only for *Standard* logic app resources, which run in the 
> *single-tenant* Azure Logic Apps environment. For more information about different resource types and runtime 
> environments in Logic Apps, review [Single-tenant versus multi-tenant and integration service environment for Azure Logic Apps](single-tenant-overview-compare.md).

When you select the **Designer** view, your workflow opens in the workflow designer.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A *Standard* logic app resource [in a single-tenant environment](single-tenant-overview-compare.md). For more information, see [Create an integration workflow with single-tenant Azure Logic Apps (Standard) in the Azure portal](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md).
- A workflow for your single-tenant logic app.

## Latest version features

The latest workflow designer offers a new experience with noteworthy features and benefits, for example:

- A new layout engine that supports more complicated workflows. 
- You can create and view complicated workflows cleanly and easily, thanks to the new layout engine, a more compact canvas, and updates to the card-based layout.
- Add and edit steps using panels separate from the workflow layout. This change gives you a cleaner and clearer canvas to view your workflow layout. For more information, review [Add steps to workflows](#add-steps-to-workflows).
- Move between steps in your workflow on the designer using keyboard navigation.
  - Move to the next card: **Ctrl** + **Down Arrow (&darr;)**
  - Move to the previous card: **Ctrl** + **Up Arrow (&uarr;)**

## Add steps to workflows

The workflow designer provides a visual way to add, edit, and delete steps in your workflow. As the first step in your workflow, always add a [*trigger*](logic-apps-overview.md#trigger). Then, complete your workflow by adding one or more [*actions*](logic-apps-overview.md#action).

To add either the trigger or an action your workflow, follow these steps:

1. Open your workflow in the designer.
1. On the designer, select **Choose an operation**, which opens a pane named either **Add a trigger** or **Add an action**. 
1. In the opened pane, find an operation by filtering the list in the following ways:
    1. Enter a service, connector, or category in the search bar to show related operations. For example, `Azure Cosmos DB` or `Data Operations`. 
    1. If you know the specific operation you want to use, enter the name in the search bar. For example, `Call an Azure function` or `When an HTTP request is received`.
    1. Select the **Built-in** tab to only show categories of [*built-in operations*](logic-apps-overview.md#built-in-operations). Or, select the **Azure** tab to show other categories of operations available through Azure.
    1. You can view only triggers or actions by selecting the **Triggers** or **Actions** tab. However, you can only add a trigger as the first step and an action as a following step. Based on the operation category, only triggers or actions might be available.

1. Select the operation you want to use. 
    :::image type="content" source="./media/designer-overview/designer-filter-operations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Logic Apps designer, showing a pane of possible operations that can be filtered by service or name." lightbox="./media/designer-overview/designer-filter-operations.png":::
1. Configure your trigger or action as needed.
    1. Mandatory fields have a red asterisk (&ast;) in front of the name.
    1. Some triggers and actions might require you to create a connection to another service. You might need to sign into an account, or enter credentials for a service. For example, if you want to use the Office 365 Outlook connector to send an email, you need to authorize your Outlook email account.
    1. Some triggers and actions use dynamic content, where you can select variables instead of entering information or expressions.
1. Select **Save** in the toolbar to save your changes. This step also verifies that your workflow is valid. 

## Code view

The **Code** view allows you to directly edit the workflow definition file in JSON format. Make sure to select **Save** to save any changes you make in this view. 

> [!TIP]
> The **Code** view is also an easy way to find and copy the workflow definition, instead of using the Azure Command Line Interface (Azure CLI) or other methods.
