# Exchange X12 messages for B2B enterprise integration using Azure Logic Apps and Enterprise Integration Pack

In Azure Logic Apps, you can create workflows that work with X12 messages by using **X12** operations. These operations include triggers and actions that you can use in your workflow to handle X12 communication. You can add X12 triggers and actions in the same way as any other trigger and action in a workflow, but you need to meet extra prerequisites before you can use X12 operations.

This article describes the requirements and settings for using X12 triggers and actions in your workflow. If you're looking for EDIFACT messages instead, review [Exchange EDIFACT messages](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-edifact.md). If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-overview.md) and [Quickstart: Create an integration workflow with multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps and the Azure portal](quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* A logic app resource and workflow where you want to use an X12 trigger or action. To use an X12 trigger, you need a blank workflow. To use an X12 action, you need a workflow that has an existing trigger.

* An [integration account](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) that's linked to your logic app resource. Both your logic app and integration account have to use the same Azure subscription and exist in the same Azure region or location.

  Your integration account also need to include the following B2B artifacts:

  * At least two [trading partners](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) that use the X12 identity qualifier.

  * An X12 [agreement](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements.md) defined between your trading partners. For information about settings to use when receiving and sending messages, review [Receive Settings](#receive-settings) and [Send Settings](#send-settings).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're working with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) schemas, you have to add a 
    > `schemaReferences` section to your agreement. For more information, review [HIPAA schemas and message types](#hipaa-schemas).

  * The [schemas](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) to use for XML validation.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're working with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) schemas, make sure to review [HIPAA schemas and message types](#hipaa-schemas).

1. Based on the agreement with the partner that exchanges messages with you, set the properties in the **Receive Settings** pane, which is organized into the following sections:

   * [Identifiers](#inbound-identifiers)
   * [Acknowledgement](#inbound-acknowledgement)
   * [Schemas](#inbound-schemas)
   * [Envelopes](#inbound-envelopes)
   * [Control Numbers](#inbound-control-numbers)

## HIPAA schemas and message types

When you work with HIPAA schemas and the 277 or 837 message types, you need to perform a few extra steps. The [document version numbers (GS8)](#outbound-control-version-number) for these message types have more than nine characters, for example, "005010X222A1". Also, some document version numbers map to variant message types. If you don't reference the correct message type in your schema and in your agreement, you get this error message:

`"The message has an unknown document type and did not resolve to any of the existing schemas configured in the agreement."`

This table lists the affected message types, any variants, and the document version numbers that map to those message types:

| Message type or variant |  Description | Document version number (GS8) |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 277 | Health Care Information Status Notification | 005010X212 |
| 837_I | Health Care Claim Institutional | 004010X096A1 <br>005010X223A1 <br>005010X223A2 |
| 837_D | Health Care Claim Dental | 004010X097A1 <br>005010X224A1 <br>005010X224A2 |
| 837_P | Health Care Claim Professional | 004010X098A1 <br>005010X222 <br>005010X222A1 |
|||

You also need to disable EDI validation when you use these document version numbers because they result in an error that the character length is invalid.

To specify these document version numbers and message types, follow these steps:

1. In your HIPAA schema, replace the current message type with the variant message type for the document version number that you want to use.

   For example, suppose you want to use document version number `005010X222A1` with the `837` message type. In your schema, replace each `"X12_00501_837"` value with the `"X12_00501_837_P"` value instead.

   To update your schema, follow these steps:

   1. In the Azure portal, go to your integration account. Find and download your schema. Replace the message type and rename the schema file, and upload your revised schema to your integration account. For more information, see [Edit schemas](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md#edit-schemas).

   1. In your agreement's message settings, select the revised schema.

1. In your agreement's `schemaReferences` object, add another entry that specifies the variant message type that matches your document version number.

   For example, suppose you want to use document version number `005010X222A1` for the `837` message type. Your agreement has a `schemaReferences` section with these properties and values:

   ```json
   "schemaReferences": [
      {
         "messageId": "837",
         "schemaVersion": "00501",
         "schemaName": "X12_00501_837"
      }
   ]
   ```

   In this `schemaReferences` section, add another entry that has these values:

   * `"messageId": "837_P"`
   * `"schemaVersion": "00501"`
   * `"schemaName": "X12_00501_837_P"`

   When you're done, your `schemaReferences` section looks like this:

   ```json
   "schemaReferences": [
      {
         "messageId": "837",
         "schemaVersion": "00501",
         "schemaName": "X12_00501_837"
      },
      {
         "messageId": "837_P",
         "schemaVersion": "00501",
         "schemaName": "X12_00501_837_P"
      }
   ]
   ```

1. In your agreement's message settings, disable EDI validation by clearing the **EDI Validation** checkbox either for each message type or for all message types if you're using the **Default** values.
