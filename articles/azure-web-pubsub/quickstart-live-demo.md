# Quickstart: Get started with chatroom live demo

The Azure Web PubSub service helps you build real-time messaging web applications using WebSockets and the publish-subscribe pattern easily. The [chatroom live demo](https://azure.github.io/azure-webpubsub/demos/clientpubsub.html) demonstrates the real-time messaging capability provided by Azure Web PubSub. With this live demo, you could easily join a chat group and send real-time message to a specific group.

## Get started with the chatroom live demo

### Get client URL with a temp access token

As the first step, you need to get the Client URL from the Azure Web PubSub instance. 

- Go to Azure portal and find out the Azure Web PubSub instance.
- Go to the `Client URL Generator` in `Key` blade. 
- Set proper `Roles`: **Send To Groups** and **Join/Leave Groups**
- Generate and copy the `Client Access URL`.

### Try the live demo 

With this live demo, you could join or leave a group and send messages to the group members easily. 

- Open [chatroom live demo](https://azure.github.io/azure-webpubsub/demos/clientpubsub.html), paste the `Client Access URL` and Connect.

> [!NOTE]
>  **Client Access URL** is a convenience tool provided in the portal to simplify your getting-started experience, you can also use this Client Access URL to do some quick connect test. To write your own application, we provide SDKs in 4 languages to help you generate the URL. 

- Try different groups to join and different groups to send messages to, and see what messages are received. For example:
    - Make two clients joining into the same group. You will see that the message could broadcast to the group members. 
    - Make two clients joining into different groups. You will see that the client cannot receive message if it is not group member. 
- You can also try to uncheck `Roles` when generating the `Client Access URL` to see what will happen when join a group or send messages to a group. For example:
    - Uncheck the `Send to Groups` permission. You will see that the client cannot send messages to the group. 
    - Uncheck the `Join/Leave Groups` permission. You will see that the client cannot join a group. 

## Next steps
