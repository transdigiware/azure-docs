# Troubleshoot the ongoing server discovery, software inventory and SQL discovery

This article helps you troubleshoot issues with ongoing server discovery, software inventory and discovery of SQL Server instances and databases.

## Discovered servers not showing in portal

If discovery state is "Discovery in progress", but don't yet see the servers in the portal, wait a few minutes:

- It takes around 15 minutes for discovery of servers running on a vCenter Server.
- It takes around two minutes for each Hyper-V host, added on appliance for discovery of servers running on the host.
- It takes around a minute for discovery of each server, added on the physical appliance.

If you wait and the state doesn't change, select **Refresh** on the **Servers** tab. This should show the count of the discovered servers in Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Azure Migrate: Server Migration.

If this doesn't work and you're discovering VMware servers:

- Verify that the vCenter account you specified has permissions set correctly, with access to at least one server.
- Azure Migrate can't discover servers on VMware if the vCenter account has access granted at vCenter VM folder level. [Learn more](set-discovery-scope.md) about scoping discovery.

## Server data not updating in portal

If discovered servers don't appear in the portal or if the server data is outdated, wait a few minutes. It takes up to 30 minutes for changes in discovered server configuration data to appear in the portal. It may take a few hours for changes in software inventory data to appear. If there's no data after this time, try refreshing, as follows

1. In **Windows, Linux and SQL Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select **Overview**.
2. Under **Manage**, select **Appliances**.
3. Select **Refresh services**.
4. Wait for the refresh operation to complete. You should now see up-to-date information.

## Deleted servers appear in portal

If you delete servers and they still appear in the portal, wait 30 minutes. If they still appear, refresh as described above.

## I imported a CSV but I see "Discovery is in progress"

This status appears if your CSV upload failed due to a validation failure. Try to import the CSV again. You can download the error report of the previous upload and follow the remediation guidance in the file to fix the errors. The error report can be downloaded from the 'Import Details' section on 'Discover servers' page.

## Do not see software inventory details even after updating guest credentials

The software inventory discovery runs once every 24 hours. If you would like to see the details immediately, refresh as follows. This may take a few minutes depending on the no. of servers discovered.

1. In **Windows, Linux and SQL Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select **Overview**.
2. Under **Manage**, select **Appliances**.
3. Select **Refresh services**.
4. Wait for the refresh operation to complete. You should now see up-to-date information.

## Unable to export software inventory

Ensure the user downloading the inventory from the portal has Contributor privileges on the subscription.

## Common software inventory errors

Azure Migrate supports software inventory, using Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment. Software inventory is currently supported for VMware only. [Learn more](how-to-discover-applications.md) about the requirements for software inventory.

The list of software inventory errors are summarized in the table below.

## Error 9014: HTTPGetRequestToRetrieveFileFailed

### Cause
The issue happens when VMware discovery agent in appliance tries to download the output file containing dependency data from the server file system through ESXi host on which the server is hosted.

### Remediation
- You can test TCP connectivity to the ESXi host _(name provided in the error message)_ on port 443 (required to be open on ESXi hosts to pull dependency data) from the appliance by opening PowerShell on appliance server and executing the following command:
    ````
    Test -NetConnection -ComputeName <Ip address of the ESXi host> -Port 443
    ````
- If command returns successful connectivity, you can go to the Azure Migrate project> Discovery and assessment>Overview>Manage>Appliances, select the appliance name and select **Refresh services**.

## Error 9018: PowerShellNotFound

### Cause
The error usually comes for servers running Windows Server 2008 or lower.

### Remediation
You need to install the required PowerShell version (2.0 or later) at this location on the server: ($SYSTEMROOT)\System32\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe. [Learn more](/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/install/installing-windows-powershell) on how to install PowerShell in Windows Server.

After installing the required PowerShell version, you can verify if the error was resolved by following steps [here](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification-using-vmware-powercli).

## Error 9022: GetWMIObjectAccessDenied

### Remediation
Make sure that the user account provided in the appliance has access to WMI Namespace and subnamespaces. You can set the access by following these steps:
1.	Go to the server which is reporting this error.
2.	Search and select ‘Run’ from the Start menu. In the ‘Run’ dialog box, type wmimgmt.msc in the ‘Open:’ text field and press enter.
3.	The wmimgmt console will open where you can find “WMI Control (Local)” in the left panel. Right click on it and select ‘Properties’ from the menu.
4.	In the ‘WMI Control (Local) Properties’ dialog box, select ‘Securities’ tab.
5.	On the Securities tab, select 'Security' button which will open ‘Security for ROOT’ dialog box.
7.	Select 'Advanced' button to open 'Advanced Security Settings for Root' dialog box. 
8.	Select 'Add' button which opens the 'Permission Entry for Root' dialog box.
9.	Click ‘Select a principal’ to open ‘Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts or Groups’ dialog box.
10.	Select the user name(s) or group(s) you want to grant access to the WMI and click 'OK'.
11. Ensure you grant execute permissions and select "This namespace and subnamespaces" in the 'Applies to:' drop-down.
12. Select 'Apply' button to save the settings and close all dialog boxes.

After getting the required access, you can verify if the error was resolved by following steps [here](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification-using-vmware-powercli).

## Error 9032: InvalidRequest

### Cause
There can be multiple reasons for this issue, one of the reason is when the username provided (server credentials) on the appliance configuration manager is having invalid XML characters, which causes error in parsing the SOAP request.

### Remediation
- Make sure the username of the server credentials does not have invalid XML characters and is in username@domain.com format popularly known as UPN format.
- After editing the credentials on the appliance, you can verify if the error was resolved by following steps [here](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification-using-vmware-powercli).


## Error 10002: ScriptExecutionTimedOutOnVm

### Cause
- This error occurs when server is slow or unresponsive and the script executed to pull the dependency data starts timing out.
- Once the discovery agent encounters this error on the server, appliance does not attempt agentless dependency analysis on the server thereafter to avoid overloading the unresponsive server.
- Hence you will continue to see the error until you check the issue with the server and restart the discovery service.

### Remediation
1. Login into the server encountering this error.
1. Run following commands on PowerShell:
   ````
   Get-WMIObject win32_operatingsystem;
   Get-WindowsFeature  | Where-Object {$_.InstallState -eq 'Installed' -or ($_.InstallState -eq $null -and $_.Installed -eq 'True')};
   Get-WmiObject Win32_Process;
   netstat -ano -p tcp | select -Skip 4;
   ````
3. If commands output the result in few seconds, then you can go to the Azure Migrate project> Discovery and assessment>Overview>Manage>Appliances, select the appliance name and select **Refresh services** to restart the discovery service.
4. If the commands are timing out without giving any output, then 
- You need to figure out which process are consuming high CPU or memory on the server.
- You can try and provide more cores/memory to that server and execute the commands again.

## Error 10005: GuestCredentialNotValid

### Remediation
- Ensure the validity of credentials _(friendly name provided in the error)_ by clicking on "Revalidate credentials" on the appliance config manager.
- Ensure that you are able to login into the impacted server using the same credential provided in the appliance.
- You can try using another user account (for the same domain, in case server is domain-joined) for that server instead of Administrator account .
- The issue can happen when Global Catalog <-> Domain Controller communication is broken. You can check this by creating a new user account in the domain controller and providing the same in the appliance. This might also require restarting the Domain controller.
- After taking the remediation steps, you can verify if the error was resolved by following steps [here](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification-using-vmware-powercli).

## Error 10012: CredentialNotProvided

### Cause
This error occurs when you have provided a domain credential with a wrong domain name on the appliance configuration manager. For example, if you have provided a domain credentials with username user@abc.com but provided a the domain name as def.com, those credentials will not be attempted if the server is connected to def.com and you will get this error message.

### Remediation
- Go to appliance configuration manager to add a server credential or edit an existing one as explained in the cause.
- After taking the remediation steps, you can verify if the error was resolved by following steps [here](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification-using-vmware-powercli).

## Mitigation verification using VMware PowerCLI
After using the mitigation steps on the errors listed above, you can verify if the mitigation worked by running few PowerCLI commands from the appliance server. If the commands succeed, it means that the issue is now resolved else you need to check and follow the remediation steps again.

1. Run the following commands to set up PowerCLI on the appliance server:
   ````
   Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI -AllowClobber
   Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore
   ````
2. Connect to vCenter Server from appliance by providing the vCenter Server IP address in the command and credentials in the prompt:
   ````
   Connect-VIServer -Server <IPAddress of vCenter Server>
   ````
3. Connect to the target server from appliance by providing the server name and server credentials (as provided on appliance):
   ````
   $vm = get-VM <VMName>
   $credential = Get-Credential
   ````
4. For software inventory, run the following commands to see you get a successful output:

  - For Windows servers:

      ```` 
        Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "powershell.exe 'Get-WMIObject win32_operatingsystem'" -GuestCredential $credential

        Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "powershell.exe Get-WindowsFeature" -GuestCredential $credential
      ```` 
   - For Linux servers:
      ````
      Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "ls" -GuestCredential $credential
      ````
5. For agentless dependency analysis, run the following commands to see you get a successful output:

  - For Windows servers:

      ```` 
      Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "powershell.exe 'Get-WmiObject Win32_Process'" -GuestCredential $credential 
  
      Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "powershell.exe 'netstat -ano -p tcp'" -GuestCredential $credential 
      ```` 
   - For Linux servers:
      ````
      Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "ps -o pid,cmd | grep -v ]$" -GuestCredential $credential

      Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "netstat -atnp | awk '{print $4,$5,$7}'" -GuestCredential $credential
      ````
6. After verifying that the mitigation worked, you can go to the Azure Migrate project> Discovery and assessment>Overview>Manage>Appliances, select the appliance name and select **Refresh services** to start a fresh discovery cycle.

## Discovered SQL Server instances and databases not in portal

After you have initiated discovery on the appliance, it may take up to 24 hours to start showing the inventory data in the portal.

If you have not provided Windows authentication or SQL Server authentication credentials on the appliance configuration manager, then add the credentials so that the appliance can use them to connect to respective SQL Server instances.

Once connected, appliance gathers configuration and performance data of SQL Server instances and databases. The SQL Server configuration data is updated once every 24 hours and the performance data is captured every 30 seconds. Hence any change to the properties of the SQL Server instance and databases such as database status, compatibility level etc. can take up to 24 hours to update on the portal.

## SQL Server instance is showing up in "Not connected" state on portal

To view the issues encountered during discovery of SQL Server instances and databases please click on "Not connected" status in connection status column on 'Discovered servers' page in your project.

Creating assessment on top of servers containing SQL instances that were not discovered completely or are in not connected state, may lead to readiness being marked as "unknown".

## Common SQL Server instances and database discovery errors

Azure Migrate supports discovery of SQL Server instances and databases running on on-premises machines, using Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment. SQL discovery is currently supported for VMware only. Refer to the [Discovery](tutorial-discover-vmware.md) tutorial to get started.

Typical SQL discovery errors are summarized in the table.

| **Error** | **Cause** | **Action** | **Guide**
|--|--|--|--|
|30000: Credentials associated with this SQL Server didn't work.|Either manually associated credentials are invalid or auto associated credentials can no longer access the SQL Server.|Add credentials for SQL Server on the appliance and wait until the next SQL discovery cycle or force refresh.| - |
