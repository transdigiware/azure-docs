# Create knowledge bases in multiple languages

This tutorial will walk through the process of creating knowledge bases in multiple languages. We use the [Surface Pen FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/surface/how-to-use-your-surface-pen-8a403519-cd1f-15b2-c9df-faa5aa924e98) URL to create knowledge bases in German and English. We then publish the knowledge bases and use the [GenerateAnswerAPI](/rest/api/cognitiveservices-qnamaker/QnAMaker4.0/Runtime/GenerateAnswer) to query them to get answers to FAQs in the desired language.

## Create Knowledge Base in German

To be able to create a knowledge base in more than one language, the language setting must be set at the creation of the first Knowledge Base (KB) of the QnA service.

> [!NOTE]
> The option to enable adding knowledge bases in multiple languages to a service is only available as part of Custom Question Answering which is a feature of Text Analytics.
>
> If you are using the GA version of QnA Maker, a separate QnA Maker resource would need to be created for each distinct language.

In **Step 2**: Enable “Add knowledge bases in multiple languages to this service” and choose **German** as the language of the KB from “Language” drop-down list.
Fill relevant details in Step 3 and 4 and finally select on **Create your KB**.
 
At this step, QnA maker reads the document and extracts QnA pairs from the source URL to create the knowledge base in the German language. The knowledge base page opens where we can edit the contents of the knowledge base.

## Create Knowledge Base in English

We now repeat the above steps with language-specific changes in the Step 2 and Step 4 to create the knowledge base in English:
1.	**Step 2**: Choose language as **English**
2.	**Step 4**: Select source file in selected language to create a knowledge base in English.
Once, the knowledge base is created, we can see the relevant QnA pairs generated by QnA maker in English as shown below:

## Publish and Query knowledge base

We are now ready to publish the two knowledge bases and query them in the desired language using the [GenerateAnswerAPI](/rest/api/cognitiveservices-qnamaker/QnAMaker4.0/Runtime/GenerateAnswer). Once a knowledge base is published, the following page is shown which provides details to query the knowledge base.

> [ ![Screenshot of UI with English questions and answers]( ../media/multiple-languages/postman.png) ]( ../media/multiple-languages/postman.png#lightbox)

The language for the incoming user query can be detected with the [Language Detection API](../../text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-language-detection.md) and the user can call the appropriate endpoint and knowledge base depending on the detected language.
