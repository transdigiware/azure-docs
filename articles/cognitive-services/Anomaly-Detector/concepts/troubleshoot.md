# Troubleshooting the multivariate API

This article provides guidance on how to troubleshoot and remediate common error messages when using the multivariate API.

## Multivariate error codes

### Common Errors

| `VariableParseError`   | Variable \<variable> parse \<error message> error.             | Cannot process the \<variable> due to runtime errors. Please refer to the \<error message> for more details or contact us with the \<error message>. |
| `MergeDataFailed`      | Failed to merge data. Please check data format.              | Data merge failed. This is possibly due to wrong data format, organization of files, etc. Please refer to the sample data for the current file structure. |

| `NoData`               | There is no effective data                                   | There is no data to train/inference after processing. Please check the start time and end time. |
| `DataExceedsLimit`     | The length of data whose timestamp is between `startTime` and `endTime` exceeds limit(\<limit>). | The size of data after processing exceeds the limit. (Currently no limit on processed data.) |
| `NotEnoughInput`       | Not enough data. The length of data is \<data length>, but the minimum length should be larger than sliding window which is \<sliding window size>. | The minimum number of data points for inference is the size of sliding window. Try to provide more data for inference. |
