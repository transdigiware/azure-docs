# Identify and diagnose Azure Virtual Desktop issues

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to Azure Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager Azure Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using Azure Virtual Desktop (classic) without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/diagnostics-role-service-2019.md).

Azure Virtual Desktop offers a diagnostics feature that allows the administrator to identify issues through a single interface. To learn more about the diagnostic capabilities of Azure Virtual Desktop, see [Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature](diagnostics-log-analytics.md).

Connections that don't reach Azure Virtual Desktop won't show up in diagnostics results because the diagnostics role service itself is part of Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop connection issues can happen when the end-user is experiencing network connectivity issues.

## Common error scenarios

The WVDErrors table tracks errors across all activity types. The column called "ServiceError" provides an additional flag marked either "True" or "False." This flag will tell you whether the error is related to the service.

* If the value is "True," the service team may have already investigated this issue. If this impacts user experience and appears a high number of times, we recommend you submit a support ticket for Azure Virtual Desktop.
* If the value is "False," this may be a misconfiguration that you can fix yourself. The error message can give you a clue about where to start.

The following table lists common errors your admins might run into.
