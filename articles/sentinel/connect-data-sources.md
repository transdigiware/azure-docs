# Connect data sources

[!INCLUDE [reference-to-feature-availability](includes/reference-to-feature-availability.md)]

After you enable Azure Sentinel, the first thing you need to do is connect your data sources. Azure Sentinel comes with many connectors for Microsoft products, available out of the box and providing real-time integration. For example, service-to-service connectors include Microsoft 365 Defender connectors and Microsoft 365 sources, such as Office 365, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft Defender for Identity, and Microsoft Cloud App Security.

You can also enable built-in connectors to the broader security ecosystem for non-Microsoft products. For example, you can use [Syslog](#syslog), [Common Event Format (CEF)](#common-event-format-cef), or [REST APIs](#rest-api-integration) to connect your data sources with Azure Sentinel.

For more information, see [Azure Sentinel partner data connectors](partner-data-connectors.md) and the [Azure Sentinel solutions catalog](sentinel-solutions-catalog.md).

## Enable a data connector

To enable a data connector in Azure Sentinel:

1. On the Azure Sentinel left navigation menu, select **Data connectors**. The **Data connectors** page shows the full list of connectors that Azure Sentinel provides, and their status. Select the connector you want to connect, and then select **Open connector page**.

   For more information, see [Service-to-service integration](#service-to-service-integration) and [Azure Sentinel partner data connectors](partner-data-connectors.md).
   

1. On the connector page, make sure you've fulfilled all the prerequisites, and follow the instructions to connect the data to Azure Sentinel. It may take some time for the logs to start syncing with Azure Sentinel. After you connect, you see a summary of the data in the **Data received** graph, and the connectivity status of the data types.

### REST API integration

Many security technologies provide a set of APIs for retrieving log files, and some data sources can use those APIs to connect to Azure Sentinel.

Data connectors that use APIs either integrate from the provider side or integrate using Azure Functions, as described in the following sections.

For a complete listing and information about these connectors, see [Azure Sentinel partner data connectors](partner-data-connectors.md).

#### REST API integration on the provider side

An API integration that is built by the provider connects with the provider data sources and pushes data into Azure Sentinel custom log tables using the [Azure Monitor Data Collector API](../azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api.md).

For more information about configuring these data connectors to send logs to Azure Sentinel, see the relevant provider documentation. 

#### REST API integration using Azure Functions

Integrations that use [Azure Functions](../azure-functions/index.yml) to connect with a provider API first format the data, and then send it to Azure Sentinel custom log tables using the [Azure Monitor Data Collector API](../azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api.md).

For more information about configuring these data connectors to connect with the provider API and collect logs in Azure Sentinel, follow the steps shown for each data connector in Azure Sentinel.

Integrations that use Azure Functions also have a **Deploy to Azure** button in their Azure Sentinel data connector page. For these integrations, do the following to simplify the configuration:

1. Select **Deploy to Azure**
1. Enter the parameter values to connect with the provider API.
1. Enter your Azure Sentinel workspace ID and key to connect with Log Analytics and send the data into Azure Sentinel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Integrations that use Azure Functions may incur additional data ingestion costs, because you host Azure Functions on your Azure tenant. For more information, see the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/).

### Agent-based integration

Azure Sentinel can use the Syslog protocol to connect via an agent to any data source that can perform real-time log streaming. For example, most on-premises data sources connect via agent-based integration.
The following sections describe the different types of Azure Sentinel agent-based data connectors. Follow the steps in each Azure Sentinel data connector page to configure connections using agent-based mechanisms.

For a complete listing of firewalls, proxies, and endpoints that connect to Azure Sentinel through CEF or Syslog, see [Azure Sentinel partner data connectors](partner-data-connectors.md).

#### Syslog

You can stream events from Linux-based, Syslog-supporting devices into Azure Sentinel by using the Log Analytics agent for Linux, formerly called the OMS agent. The Log Analytics agent is supported for any device that allows you to install the Log Analytics agent directly on the device.

The device's built-in Syslog daemon collects local events of the specified types, and forwards them locally to the agent, which then streams them to your Log Analytics workspace. After successful configuration, the data appears in the Log Analytics Syslog table.

Depending on the device type, the agent is installed either directly on the device, or on a dedicated Linux-based log forwarder. The Log Analytics agent receives events from the Syslog daemon over UDP. If a Linux machine is expected to collect a high volume of Syslog events, it sends events over TCP from the Syslog daemon to the agent, and from there to Log Analytics.

For more information, see [Connect Syslog-based appliances to Azure Sentinel](connect-syslog.md). 

#### Common Event Format (CEF)

Log formats vary, but many sources support CEF-based formatting. The Azure Sentinel agent, which is actually the Log Analytics agent, converts CEF-formatted logs into a format that Log Analytics can ingest.

For data sources that emit data in CEF, set up the Syslog agent and then configure the CEF data flow. After successful configuration, the data appears in the **CommonSecurityLog** table.

For more information, see [Connect CEF-based appliances to Azure Sentinel](connect-common-event-format.md).

#### Custom logs

Some data sources have logs available for collection as files on Windows or Linux. You can collect these logs by using the Log Analytics custom log collection agent.

Follow the steps in each Azure Sentinel data connector page to connect using the Log Analytics custom log collection agent. After successful configuration, the data appears in custom tables.

For more information, see [Collect custom logs with the Log Analytics agent](../azure-monitor/agents/data-sources-custom-logs.md).

## Data connector support

Both Microsoft and other organizations author Azure Sentinel data connectors. Each data connector has one of the following support types:

| Support type| Description|
