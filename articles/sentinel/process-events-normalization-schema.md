# Azure Sentinel Process Event normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The Process Event normalization schema is used to describe the operating system activity of executing and terminating a process. Such events are reported by operating systems as well as by security systems such as EDR (End Point Detection and Response) systems. A process, as defined by OSSEM, is a containment and management object that represents a running instance of a program. Note that processes do not run. Instead, processes manage threads that run and execute code.

For more information about normalization in Azure Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Azure Sentinel Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Process Event normalization schema is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Parsers

Azure Sentinel provides the following built-in, product-specific process event parsers:

- **Security Events process creation (Event 4688)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Security Events process termination (Event 4689)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Sysmon process creation (Event 1)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Sysmon process termination (Event 5)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoints process creation**

To use the source-agnostic parsers that unify all of listed parsers and ensure that you analyze across all the configured sources, use the following table names in your queries:

- **imProcessCreate**, for queries that require process creation information. This is the most common case.
- **imProcessTerminate** for queries that require process termination information.
- **imProcessEvents** for queries that require both process creation and termination information. In such cases, the `EventType` field enables you to distinguish between the events, and is set to `ProcessCreate` or `ProcessTerminate`, respectively. Process termination events generally include a lot less information than process creation events.

Deploy the [source-agnostic and source-specific parsers](normalization.md#parsers) from the [Azure Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelProcessEvents).

## Add your own normalized parsers

When implementing custom parsers for the [Process Event](normalization.md#the-process-entity) information model, name your KQL functions using the following syntax: `imProcess<Type><vendor><Product>`, where `Type` is either `Create`, `Terminate`, or `Event` if the parser implements both creation and termination events.

Add your KQL function to the `imProcess<Type>` and `imProcess` source-agnostic parsers to ensure that any content using the [Process Event](normalization.md#the-process-entity) model also uses your new parser.

## Normalized content for process activity data

The following Azure Sentinel content works with any process activity that's normalized using the Azure Sentinel Information Model:

- **Analytics rules**:

## Schema details

The Process Event information model is aligned is the [OSSEM Process entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/process.md).

### Log Analytics fields

The following fields are generated by Log Analytics for each record, and can be overridden when creating a custom connector.

| Field         | Type     | Discussion      |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <a name="timegenerated"></a>**TimeGenerated** | datetime | The time the event was generated by the reporting device.|
| **_ResourceId**   | guid     | The Azure Resource ID of the reporting device or service, or the log forwarder resource ID for events forwarded using Syslog, CEF or WEF. |
| | | |

> [!NOTE]
> Log Analytics also adds other fields that are less relevant to security use cases. For more information, see [Standard columns in Azure Monitor Logs](../azure-monitor/logs/log-standard-columns.md).

The fields listed in the table below are specific to Process events, but are similar to fields in other schemas and follow similar naming conventions.

The process event schema references the following entities, which are central to process creation and termination activity:

- **Actor**. The user that initiated the process creation or termination.
- **ActingProcess**. The process used by the Actor to initiate the process creation or termination.
- **TargetProcess**. The new process.
- **TargetUser**. The user whose credentials are used to create the new process.
- **ParentProcess**. The process that initiated the Actor Process.
