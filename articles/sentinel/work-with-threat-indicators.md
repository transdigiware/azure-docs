# Work with threat indicators in Azure Sentinel

You can integrate threat intelligence (TI) into Azure Sentinel through the following activities:

- **Import threat intelligence** into Azure Sentinel by enabling **data connectors** to various TI [platforms](connect-threat-intelligence-tip.md) and [feeds](connect-threat-intelligence-taxii.md).

- **View and manage** the imported threat intelligence in **Logs** and in the **Threat Intelligence** blade of Azure Sentinel.

- **Detect threats** and generate security alerts and incidents using the built-in **Analytics** rule templates based on your imported threat intelligence.

- **Visualize key information** about your imported threat intelligence in Azure Sentinel with the **Threat Intelligence workbook**.


## View your threat indicators in Azure Sentinel

### Find and view your indicators in Logs

You can view your successfully imported threat indicators, regardless of the source feed or the connector used, in the **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table (under the **Azure Sentinel** group) in **Logs** which is where all your Azure Sentinel event data is stored. This table is the basis for threat intelligence queries performed by other Azure Sentinel features such as Analytics and Workbooks.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you’ve imported threat indicators using either threat intelligence data connector.

1. Select **Logs** from the **General** section of the Azure Sentinel menu.

1. The **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table is located under the **Azure Sentinel** group.

1. Select the **Preview data** icon (the eye) next to the table name and select the **See in query editor** button to execute a query which will show records from this table.

Your results should look similar to the sample threat indicator shown below:

### Find and view your indicators in the threat intelligence blade

You can also view and manage your indicators in the new **Threat intelligence** blade, accessible from the main Azure Sentinel menu. You can sort, filter, and search your imported threat indicators without even writing a Log Analytics query. This feature also allows you to create threat indicators directly within the Azure Sentinel interface, as well as perform two of the most common threat intelligence administrative tasks: indicator tagging and creating new indicators related to security investigations.

#### Create a new indicator

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you’ve imported threat indicators using either threat intelligence data connector.

1. Select **Threat Intelligence** from the Threat Management section of the Azure Sentinel menu.

1. Select the **Add new** button from the menu bar at the top of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/work-with-threat-indicators/threat-intel-add-new-indicator.png" alt-text="Add a new threat indicator" lightbox="media/work-with-threat-indicators/threat-intel-add-new-indicator.png":::

1. Choose the indicator type, then complete the form on the **New indicator** panel. The required fields are marked with a red asterisk (*).

1. Select **Apply**. The indicator is added to the indicators list, and is also sent to the *ThreatIntelligenceIndicator* table in **Logs**.

#### Tag threat indicators

Tagging threat indicators is an easy way to group them together to make them easier to find. Typically, you might apply a tag to indicators related to a particular incident, or to those representing threats from a particular known actor or well-known attack campaign. You can tag threat indicators individually, or multi-select indicators and tag them all at once. Shown below is an example of tagging multiple indicators with an incident ID. Since tagging is free-form, a recommended practice is to create standard naming conventions for threat indicator tags. You can apply multiple tags to each indicator.

## Detect threats with threat indicator-based analytics

The most important use case for threat indicators in SIEM solutions like Azure Sentinel is to power threat detection analytics rules. These indicator-based rules compare raw events from your data sources against your threat indicators to determine the presence of security threats in your organization. In Azure Sentinel **Analytics**, you create analytics rules that run on a scheduled basis and generate security alerts. The rules are driven by queries, along with configurations that determine how often the rule should run, what kind of query results should generate security alerts and incidents, and which automations to trigger in response.

While you can always create new analytics rules from scratch, Azure Sentinel provides a set of built-in rule templates, created by Microsoft security engineers, that you can use as-is or modify to meet your needs. You can readily identify the rule templates that use threat indicators, as they are all titled beginning with "*TI map*…". All these rule templates operate similarly, with the only difference being which type of threat indicators are used (domain, email, file hash, IP address, or URL) and which event type to match against. Each template lists the required data sources needed for the rule to function, so you can see at a glance if you have the necessary events already imported in Azure Sentinel. When you edit and save an existing rule template or create a new rule, it is enabled by default.

Here's an example of how to enable and configure the rule to generate security alerts using the threat indicators you’ve imported into Azure Sentinel. For this example, use the rule template called **TI map IP entity to AzureActivity**. This rule will match any IP address-type threat indicator with all your Azure Activity events. When a match is found, an **alert** will be generated, as well as a corresponding **incident** for investigation by your security operations team. This analytics rule will operate successfully only if you have enabled one or both of the **Threat Intelligence** data connectors (to import threat indicators) and the **Azure Activity** data connector (to import your Azure subscription-level events).

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you imported threat indicators using the **Threat Intelligence** data connectors and Azure activity data using the **Azure Activity** data connector.

1. Select **Analytics** from the **Configuration** section of the Azure Sentinel menu.

1. Select the **Rule templates** tab to see the list of available analytics rule templates.

1. Find the rule titled **TI map IP entity to AzureActivity** and ensure you have connected all the required data sources as shown below.

    :::image type="content" source="media/work-with-threat-indicators/threat-intel-required-data-sources.png" alt-text="Required data sources":::

1. Select this rule and select the **Create rule** button. This opens a wizard to configure the rule. Complete the settings here and select the **Next: Set rule logic >** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/work-with-threat-indicators/threat-intel-create-analytics-rule.png" alt-text="Create analytics rule":::

1. The rule logic portion of the wizard has been pre-populated with the following items:
    - The query which will be used in the rule.

    - Entity mappings, which tell Azure Sentinel how to recognize entities like Accounts, IP addresses, and URLs, so that **incidents** and **investigations** understand how to work with the data in any security alerts generated by this rule.

    - The schedule to run this rule.

    - The number of query results needed before a security alert is generated.

    The default settings in the template are:
    - Run once an hour.

    - Match any IP address threat indicators from the **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table with any IP address found in the last one hour of events from the **AzureActivity** table.

    - Generate a security alert if the query results are greater than zero, meaning if any matches are found.

    You can leave the default settings or change any of these to meet your requirements, and you can define incident-generation settings on the **Incident settings** tab. For more information, see [Create custom analytics rules to detect threats](tutorial-detect-threats-custom.md). When you are finished, select the **Automated response** tab.

1. Configure any automation you’d like to trigger when a security alert is generated from this analytics rule. Automation in Azure Sentinel is done using combinations of **automation rules** and **playbooks** powered by Azure Logic Apps. To learn more, see this [Tutorial: Use playbooks with automation rules in Azure Sentinel](./tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md). When finished, select the **Next: Review >** button to continue.

1. When you see the message that the rule validation has passed, select the **Create** button and you are finished.

You can find your enabled rules in the **Active rules** tab of the **Analytics** section of Azure Sentinel. You can edit, enable, disable, duplicate or delete the active rule from there. The new rule runs immediately upon activation, and from then on will run on its defined schedule.

According to the default settings, each time the rule runs on its schedule, any results found will generate a security alert. Security alerts in Azure Sentinel can be viewed in the **Logs** section of Azure Sentinel, in the **SecurityAlert** table under the **Azure Sentinel** group.

In Azure Sentinel, the alerts generated from analytics rules also generate security incidents which can be found in **Incidents** under **Threat Management** on the Azure Sentinel menu. Incidents are what your security operations teams will triage and investigate to determine the appropriate response actions. You can find detailed information in this [Tutorial: Investigate incidents with Azure Sentinel](./tutorial-investigate-cases.md).

## Workbooks provide insights about your threat intelligence

You can use a purpose-built Azure Sentinel workbook to visualize key information about your threat intelligence in Azure Sentinel, and you can easily customize the workbook according to your business needs.
Here's how to find the threat intelligence workbook provided in Azure Sentinel, and an example of how to make edits to the workbook to customize it.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the **Azure Sentinel** service.

1. Choose the **workspace** to which you’ve imported threat indicators using either threat intelligence data connector.

1. Select **Workbooks** from the **Threat management** section of the Azure Sentinel menu.

1. Find the workbook titled **Threat Intelligence** and verify you have data in the **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator** table as shown below.

    :::image type="content" source="media/work-with-threat-indicators/threat-intel-verify-data.png" alt-text="Verify data":::
 
1. Select the **Save** button and choose an Azure location to store the workbook. This step is required if you are going to modify the workbook in any way and save your changes.

1. Now select the **View saved workbook** button to open the workbook for viewing and editing.

1. Add the following text to the **Log Analytics workspace Log Query** text box:
    ```kusto
    ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
    | summarize count() by ThreatType
    ```

1. In the **Visualization** drop-down, select **Bar chart**.

1. Select the **Done editing** button. You’ve created a new chart for your workbook.

    :::image type="content" source="media/work-with-threat-indicators/threat-intel-bar-chart.png" alt-text="Bar chart":::

Workbooks provide powerful interactive dashboards that give you insights into all aspects of Azure Sentinel. There is a whole lot you can do with workbooks, and while the provided templates are a great starting point, you will likely want to dive in and customize these templates, or create new dashboards combining many different data sources so you can visualize your data in unique ways. Since Azure Sentinel workbooks are based on Azure Monitor workbooks, there is already extensive documentation available, and many more templates. A great place to start is this article on how to [Create interactive reports with Azure Monitor workbooks](../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). 

There is also a rich community of [Azure Monitor workbooks on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Application-Insights-Workbooks) where you can download additional templates and contribute your own templates.
