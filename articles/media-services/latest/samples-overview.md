# Media Services v3 samples

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

This article contains a list of all the samples available for Media Services organized by method and SDK.  Samples include .NET, Node.JS (Typescript), Python and Java as well as REST with Postman.

## REST Postman collection

The [REST Postman](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-rest-postman) samples includes a Postman environment and collection for you to import into the Postman client. The Postman collection samples are recommended for getting familiar with the API structure and how it works with Azure Resource Management (ARM), as well as the structure of calls from the client SDKs. 

For production workloads you should be using the client SDKs that wrap this REST API as they support retry policies defined by the Azure Resource Management gateway. If you choose to implement REST API calls directly you should be aware that there are cases where retries are required to achieve higher SLAs.

## Samples by SDK

You'll find description and links to the samples you may be looking for in each of the tabs.

## [.NET](#tab/net/)

| Sample | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [Account/CreateAccount](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/Account/CreateAccount)|The sample shows how to create a Media Services account and set the primary storage account, in addition to advanced configuration settings including Key Delivery IP allowlist, Managed Identity, storage auth, and bring your own encryption key.|
| [VideoEncoding/Encoding_PredefinedPreset](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/VideoEncoding/Encoding_PredefinedPreset)|The sample shows how to submit a job using a built-in preset and an HTTP URL input, publish output asset for streaming, and download results for verification.|
| [VideoEncoding/Encoding_H264](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/VideoEncoding/Encoding_H264)|The sample shows how to submit a job using a custom H.264 encoding preset and an HTTP URL input, publish output asset for streaming, and download results for verification.|
| [VideoEncoding/Encoding_HEVC](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/VideoEncoding/Encoding_HEVC)|The sample shows how to submit a job using a custom HEVC encoding preset and an HTTP URL input, publish output asset for streaming, and download results for verification.|
| [VideoEncoding/Encoding_StitchTwoAssets](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/VideoEncoding/Encoding_StitchTwoAssets)|The sample shows how to submit a job using the JobInputSequence to stitch together 2 or more assets that may be clipped by start or end time. The resulting encoded file is a single video with all assets stitched together.  The sample will also  publish output asset for streaming and download results for verification.|
| [VideoEncoding/Encoding_SpriteThumbnail](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/VideoEncoding/Encoding_SpriteThumbnail)|The sample shows how to submit a job using a custom preset with a thumbnail sprite and an HTTP URL input, publish output asset for streaming, and download results for verification.|

| [VideoAnalytics/VideoAnalyzer](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/VideoAnalytics/VideoAnalyzer)|This sample illustrates how to create a video analyzer transform, upload a video file to an input asset, submit a job with the transform and download the results for verification.|
| [AudioAnalytics/AudioAnalyzer](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/AudioAnalytics/AudioAnalyzer)|This sample illustrates how to create a audio analyzer transform, upload a media file to an input asset, submit a job with the transform and download the results for verification.|
| [ContentProtection/BasicAESClearKey](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/ContentProtection/BasicAESClearKey)|This sample demonstrates how to create a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset, submit a job, create a ContentKeyPolicy using a secret key, associate the ContentKeyPolicy with StreamingLocator, get a token and print a url for playback in Azure Media Player. When a stream is requested by a player, Media Services uses the specified key to dynamically encrypt your content with AES-128 and Azure Media Player uses the token to decrypt.|
| [ContentProtection/BasicWidevine](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/ContentProtection/BasicWidevine)|This sample demonstrates how to create a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset, submit a job, create a ContentKeyPolicy with Widevine configuration using a secret key, associate the ContentKeyPolicy with StreamingLocator, get a token and print a url for playback in a Widevine Player. When a user requests Widevine-protected content, the player application requests a license from the Media Services license service. If the player application is authorized, the Media Services license service issues a license to the player. A Widevine license contains the decryption key that can be used by the client player to decrypt and stream the content.|

When a user requests PlayReady-protected content, the player application requests a license from the Media Services license service. If the player application is authorized, the Media Services license service issues a license to the player. A PlayReady license contains the decryption key that can be used by the client player to decrypt and stream the content.|
| [ContentProtection/OfflinePlayReadyAndWidevine](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/ContentProtection/OfflinePlayReadyAndWidevine)|This sample demonstrates how to dynamically encrypt your content with PlayReady and Widevine DRM and play the content without requesting a license from license service. It shows how to create a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset, submit a job, create a ContentKeyPolicy with open restriction and PlayReady/Widevine persistent configuration, associate the ContentKeyPolicy with a StreamingLocator and print a url for playback.|
| [Streaming/AssetFilters](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet/tree/main/Streaming/AssetFilters)|This sample demonstrates how to create a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset, submit a job, create an asset-filter and an account-filter, associate the filters to streaming locators and print urls for playback.|
