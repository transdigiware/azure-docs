# Prerequisites to deploy the data controller in direct connectivity mode

This article describes how to prepare to deploy a data controller for Azure Arc-enabled data services in direct connect mode. Deploying Azure Arc data controller requires additional understanding and concepts as described in [Plan to deploy Azure Arc-enabled data services](plan-azure-arc-data-services.md).

[!INCLUDE [azure-arc-data-preview](../../../includes/azure-arc-data-preview.md)]

At a high level, the prerequisites for creating Azure Arc data controller in **direct** connectivity mode include:

1. Connect Kubernetes cluster to Azure using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes
2. Create the service principal and configure roles for metrics
3. Create Azure Arc-enabled data services data controller. This step involves creating
    - Azure Arc data services extension
    - custom location
    - Azure Arc data controller

## 1. Connect Kubernetes cluster to Azure using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes

Connecting your kubernetes cluster to Azure can be done by using the ```az``` CLI, with the following extensions as well as Helm.

#### Install tools

- Helm version 3.3+ ([install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/))
- Install or upgrade to the latest version of Azure CLI ([install](/sql/azdata/install/deploy-install-azdata))

#### Add extensions for Azure CLI

Install the latest versions of the following az extensions:
- ```k8s-extension```
- ```connectedk8s```
- ```k8s-configuration```
- `customlocation`

Run the following commands to install the az CLI extensions:

```azurecli
az extension add --name k8s-extension
az extension add --name connectedk8s
az extension add --name k8s-configuration
az extension add --name customlocation
```

If you've previously installed the ```k8s-extension```, ```connectedk8s```, ```k8s-configuration```, `customlocation` extensions, update to the latest version using the following command:

```azurecli
az extension update --name k8s-extension
az extension update --name connectedk8s
az extension update --name k8s-configuration
az extension update --name customlocation
```
#### Connect your cluster to Azure

To complete this task, follow the steps in [Connect an existing Kubernetes cluster to Azure arc](../kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster.md).

After you connect your cluster to Azure, continue to create a Service Principal. 

## 2. Create service principal and configure roles for metrics

Follow the steps detailed in the [Upload metrics](upload-metrics-and-logs-to-azure-monitor.md) article and create a Service Principal and grant the roles as described the article. 

The SPN ClientID, TenantID, and Client Secret information will be required when you [deploy Azure Arc data controller](create-data-controller-direct-azure-portal.md). 

## 3. Create Azure Arc data services

After you have completed these prerequisites, you can [Deploy Azure Arc data controller | Direct connect mode](create-data-controller-direct-azure-portal.md).
