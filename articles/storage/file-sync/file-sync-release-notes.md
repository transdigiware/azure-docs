# Release notes for the Azure File Sync agent
Azure File Sync allows you to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files without giving up the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Your Windows Server installations are transformed into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally (including SMB, NFS, and FTPS). You can have as many caches as you need around the world.

This article provides the release notes for the supported versions of the Azure File Sync agent.

### Azure File Sync agent update policy
[!INCLUDE [storage-sync-files-agent-update-policy](../../../includes/storage-sync-files-agent-update-policy.md)]

## Agent version 13.0.0.0
The following release notes are for version 13.0.0.0 of the Azure File Sync agent (released July 12, 2021).

### Improvements and issues that are fixed
- Authoritative upload  
	- Authoritative upload is a new mode available when creating the first server endpoint in a sync group. It is useful for the scenario where the cloud (Azure file share) has some/most of the data but is outdated and needs to be caught up with the more recent data on the new server endpoint. This is the case in offline migration scenarios like DataBox, for instance. When a DataBox is filled and sent to Azure, the users of the local server will keep changing / adding / deleting files on the local server. That makes the data in the DataBox and thus the Azure file share, slightly outdated. With Authoritative Upload, you can now tell the server and cloud, how to resolve this case and get the cloud seamlessly updated with the latest changes on the server. 

		No matter how the data got to the cloud, this mode can update the Azure file share if the data stems from the matching location on the server. Be sure to avoid large directory restructures between the initial copy to the cloud and catching up with Authoritative Upload. This will ensure you are only transporting updates. Changes to directory names will cause all files in these renamed directories to be uploaded again. This functionality is comparable to semantics of RoboCopy /MIR = mirror source to target, including removing files on the target that no longer exist on the source. 
		
		Authoritative Upload replaces the "Offline Data Transfer" feature for DataBox integration with Azure File Sync via a staging share. A staging share is no longer required to use DataBox. New Offline Data Transfer jobs can no longer be started with the AFS V13 agent. Existing jobs on a server will continue even with the upgrade to agent version 13.

- Portal improvements to view cloud change enumeration and sync progress  
	- When a new sync group is created, any connected server endpoint can only begin sync, when cloud change enumeration is complete.  In case files already exist in the cloud endpoint (Azure file share) of this sync group, change enumeration of content in the cloud can take some time. The more items (files and folders) exist in the namespace, the longer this process can take. Admins will now be able to obtain cloud change enumeration progress in the Azure portal to estimate an eta for completion / sync to start with servers.

- Support for server rename  
	- If a registered server is renamed, Azure File Sync will now show the new server name in the portal. If the server was renamed prior to the v13 release, the server name in the portal will now be updated to show the correct server name.

- Support for Windows Server 2022 Preview  
	- The Azure File Sync agent is now supported on Windows Server 2022 Preview build 20348 or later.

	> [!Note]  
	> Windows Server 2022 adds support for TLS 1.3 which is not currently supported by Azure File Sync.  If the [TLS settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/security/tls/tls-ssl-schannel-ssp-overview) are managed via group policy, the server must be configured to support TLS 1.2. 

- Miscellaneous improvements
	- Reliability improvements for sync, cloud tiering and cloud change enumeration.
	- If a large number of files is changed on the server, sync upload is now performed from a VSS snapshot which reduces per-item errors and sync session failures. 
	- The Invoke-StorageSyncFileRecall cmdlet will now recall all tiered files associated with a server endpoint, even if the file has moved outside the server endpoint location. 
	- Explorer.exe is now excluded from cloud tiering last access time tracking.
	- New telemetry (Event ID 6664) to monitor the orphaned tiered files cleanup progress after removing a server endpoint with cloud tiering enabled.


### Evaluation Tool
Before deploying Azure File Sync, you should evaluate whether it is compatible with your system using the Azure File Sync evaluation tool. This tool is an Azure PowerShell cmdlet that checks for potential issues with your file system and dataset, such as unsupported characters or an unsupported OS version. For installation and usage instructions, see [Evaluation Tool](file-sync-planning.md#evaluation-cmdlet) section in the planning guide. 

### Agent installation and server configuration
For more information on how to install and configure the Azure File Sync agent with Windows Server, see [Planning for an Azure File Sync deployment](file-sync-planning.md) and [How to deploy Azure File Sync](file-sync-deployment-guide.md).

- A restart is required for servers that have an existing Azure File Sync agent installation if the agent version is less than version 12.0.
- The agent installation package must be installed with elevated (admin) permissions.
- The agent is not supported on Nano Server deployment option.
- The agent is supported only on Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2022 Preview.
- The agent requires at least 2 GiB of memory. If the server is running in a virtual machine with dynamic memory enabled, the VM should be configured with a minimum 2048 MiB of memory. See [Recommended system resources](file-sync-planning.md#recommended-system-resources)Â for more information.
- The Storage Sync Agent (FileSyncSvc) service does not support server endpoints located on a volume that has the system volume information (SVI) directory compressed. This configuration will lead to unexpected results.

### Interoperability
- Antivirus, backup, and other applications that access tiered files can cause undesirable recall unless they respect the offline attribute and skip reading the content of those files. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Azure File Sync](file-sync-troubleshoot.md).
- File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) file screens can cause endless sync failures when files are blocked because of the file screen.
- Running sysprep on a server that has the Azure File Sync agent installed is not supported and can lead to unexpected results. The Azure File Sync agent should be installed after deploying the server image and completing sysprep mini-setup.

### Sync limitations
The following items don't sync, but the rest of the system continues to operate normally:
- Files with unsupported characters. See [Troubleshooting guide](file-sync-troubleshoot.md#handling-unsupported-characters) for list of unsupported characters.
- Files or directories that end with a period.
- Paths that are longer than 2,048 characters.
- The system access control list (SACL) portion of a security descriptor that's used for auditing.
- Extended attributes.
- Alternate data streams.
- Reparse points.
- Hard links.
- Compression (if it's set on a server file) isn't preserved when changes sync to that file from other endpoints.
- Any file that's encrypted with EFS (or other user mode encryption) that prevents the service from reading the data.

    > [!Note]  
    > Azure File Sync always encrypts data in transit. Data is always encrypted at rest in Azure.
 
### Server endpoint
- A server endpoint can be created only on an NTFS volume. ReFS, FAT, FAT32, and other file systems aren't currently supported by Azure File Sync.
- Cloud tiering is not supported on the system volume. To create a server endpoint on the system volume, disable cloud tiering when creating the server endpoint.
- Failover Clustering is supported only with clustered disks, but not with Cluster Shared Volumes (CSVs).
- A server endpoint can't be nested. It can coexist on the same volume in parallel with another endpoint.
- Do not store an OS or application paging file within a server endpoint location.
- The server name in the portal is not updated if the server is renamed.

### Cloud endpoint
- Azure File Sync supports making changes to the Azure file share directly. However, any changes made on the Azure file share first need to be discovered by an Azure File Sync change detection job. A change detection job is initiated for a cloud endpoint once every 24 hours. To immediately sync files that are changed in the Azure file share, the [Invoke-AzStorageSyncChangeDetection](/powershell/module/az.storagesync/invoke-azstoragesyncchangedetection) PowerShell cmdlet can be used to manually initiate the detection of changes in the Azure file share. In addition, changes made to an Azure file share over the REST protocol will not update the SMB last modified time and will not be seen as a change by sync.
- The storage sync service and/or storage account can be moved to a different resource group, subscription, or Azure AD tenant. After the  storage sync service or storage account is moved, you need to give the Microsoft.StorageSync application access to the storage account (see [Ensure Azure File Sync has access to the storage account](file-sync-troubleshoot.md?tabs=portal1%252cportal#troubleshoot-rbac)).

    > [!Note]  
    > When creating the cloud endpoint, the storage sync service and storage account must be in the same Azure AD tenant. Once the cloud endpoint is created, the storage sync service and storage account can be moved to different Azure AD tenants.

### Cloud tiering
- If a tiered file is copied to another location by using Robocopy, the resulting file isn't tiered. The offline attribute might be set because Robocopy incorrectly includes that attribute in copy operations.
- When copying files using robocopy, use the /MIR option to preserve file timestamps. This will ensure older files are tiered sooner than recently accessed files.

## Agent version 12.1.0.0
The following release notes are for version 12.1.0.0 of the Azure File Sync agent released May 20, 2021. These notes are in addition to the release notes listed for version 12.0.0.0.

### Improvements and issues that are fixed 
The v12.0 agent release had two bugs which are fixed in this release:
- Agent auto-update fails to update the agent to a later version.
- FileSyncErrorsReport.ps1 script does not provide the list of per-item errors.

## Agent version 12.0.0.0
The following release notes are for version 12.0.0.0 of the Azure File Sync agent (released March 26, 2021).

### Improvements and issues that are fixed
- New portal experience to configure network access policy and private endpoint connections
	- You can now use the portal to disable access to the Storage Sync Service public endpoint and to approve, reject and remove private endpoint connections. To configure the network access policy and private endpoint connections, open the Storage Sync Service portal, go to the Settings section and click Network.
 
- Cloud Tiering support for volume cluster sizes larger than 64KiB
	- Cloud Tiering now supports volume cluster sizes up to 2MiB on Server 2019. To learn more, see [What is the minimum file size for a file to tier?](./file-sync-choose-cloud-tiering-policies.md#minimum-file-size-for-a-file-to-tier).
 
- Measure bandwidth and latency to Azure File Sync service and storage account
	- The Test-StorageSyncNetworkConnectivity cmdlet can now be used to measure latency and bandwidth to the Azure File Sync service and storage account. Latency to the Azure File Sync service and storage account is measured by default when running the cmdlet.  Upload and download bandwidth to the storage account is measured when using the "-MeasureBandwidth" parameter.
 
		For example, to measure bandwidth and latency to the Azure File Sync service and storage account, run the following PowerShell commands:
 
 		```powershell
		Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll"
		Test-StorageSyncNetworkConnectivity -MeasureBandwidth 
		``` 
 
- Improved error messages in the portal when server endpoint creation fails
	- We heard your feedback and have improved the error messages and guidance when server endpoint creation fails.
 
- Miscellaneous performance and reliability improvements
	- Improved change detection performance to detect files that have changed in the Azure file share.
	- Performance improvements for reconciliation sync sessions. 
	- Sync improvements to reduce ECS_E_SYNC_METADATA_KNOWLEDGE_SOFT_LIMIT_REACHED and ECS_E_SYNC_METADATA_KNOWLEDGE_LIMIT_REACHED errors.
	- Fixed a bug that causes data corruption if cloud tiering is enabled and tiered files are copied using Robocopy with the /B parameter.
	- Fixed a bug that can cause files to fail to tier on Server 2019 if Data Deduplication is enabled on the volume.
	- Fixed a bug that can cause AFSDiag to fail to compress files if a file is larger than 2GiB.

## Agent version 11.3.0.0
The following release notes are for version 11.3.0.0 of the Azure File Sync agent released April 7, 2021. These notes are in addition to the release notes listed for version 11.1.0.0.

### Improvements and issues that are fixed 
Fixed a bug that causes data corruption if cloud tiering is enabled and tiered files are copied using Robocopy with the /B parameter.

## Agent version 11.2.0.0
The following release notes are for version 11.2.0.0 of the Azure File Sync agent released February 2, 2021. These notes are in addition to the release notes listed for version 11.1.0.0.

### Improvements and issues that are fixed 
- If a sync session is canceled due to a high number of per-item errors, sync may go through reconciliation when a new session starts if the Azure File Sync service determines a custom sync session is needed to correct the per-item errors.
- Registering a server using the Register-AzStorageSyncServer cmdlet may fail with "Unhandled Exception" error.
- New PowerShell cmdlet (Add-StorageSyncAllowedServerEndpointPath) to configure allowed server endpoints paths on a server. This cmdlet is useful for scenarios in which the Azure File Sync deployment is managed by a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) or Service Provider and the customer wants to configure allowed server endpoints paths on a server. When creating a server endpoint, if the path specified is not in the allowlist, the server endpoint creation will fail. Note, this is an optional feature and all supported paths are allowed by default when creating a server endpoint.  

	
	- To add a server endpoint path thatâs allowed, run the following PowerShell commands on the server:

	```powershell
	Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll' -verbose
	Add-StorageSyncAllowedServerEndpointPath -Path <path>
	```  

	- To get the list of supported paths, run the following PowerShell command:
	
	```powershell
	Get-StorageSyncAllowedServerEndpointPath
	```  	
	- To remove a path, run the following PowerShell command:
	
	```powershell
	Remove-StorageSyncAllowedServerEndpointPath -Path <path>
	```  
## Agent version 11.1.0.0
The following release notes are for version 11.1.0.0 of the Azure File Sync agent (released November 4, 2020).

### Improvements and issues that are fixed
- New cloud tiering modes to control initial download and proactive recall
	- Initial download mode: you can now choose how you want your files to be initially downloaded onto your new server endpoint. Want all your files tiered or as many files as possible downloaded onto your server by last modified timestamp? You can do that! Can't use cloud tiering? You can now opt to avoid tiered files on your system. To learn more, see [Create a server endpoint](../file-sync/file-sync-deployment-guide.md?tabs=azure-portal%252cproactive-portal#create-a-server-endpoint) section in the Deploy Azure File Sync documentation.
	- Proactive recall mode: whenever a file is created or modified, you can proactively recall it to servers that you specify within the same sync group. This makes the file readily available for consumption in each server you specified. Have teams across the globe working on the same data? Enable proactive recalling so that when the team arrives the next morning, all the files updated by a team in a different time zone are downloaded and ready to go! To learn more, see [Proactively recall new and changed files from an Azure file share](../file-sync/file-sync-deployment-guide.md?tabs=azure-portal%252cproactive-portal#proactively-recall-new-and-changed-files-from-an-azure-file-share) section in the Deploy Azure File Sync documentation.

- Exclude applications from cloud tiering last access time tracking
	You can now exclude applications from last access time tracking. When an application accesses a file, the last access time for the file is updated in the cloud tiering database. Applications that scan the file system like anti-virus cause all files to have the same last access time which impacts when files are tiered.

	To exclude applications from last access time tracking, add the process name to the HeatTrackingProcessNameExclusionList registry setting which is located under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure\StorageSync.

	Example: reg ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure\StorageSync" /v HeatTrackingProcessNameExclusionList /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d "SampleApp.exe\0AnotherApp.exe" /f

    > [!Note]  
    > Data Deduplication and File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) processes are excluded by default (hard coded) and the process exclusion list is refreshed every 5 minutes.

- Miscellaneous performance and reliability improvements
	- Improved change detection performance to detect files that have changed in the Azure file share.
	- Improved sync upload performance.
	- Initial upload is now performed from a VSS snapshot which reduces per-item errors and sync session failures.
	- Sync reliability improvements for certain I/O patterns.
	- Fixed a bug to prevent the sync database from going back-in-time on failover clusters when a failover occurs.
	- Improved recall performance when accessing a tiered file.

    > When creating the cloud endpoint, the storage sync service and storage account must be in the same Azure AD tenant. Once the cloud endpoint is created, the storage sync service and storage account can be moved to different Azure AD tenants.

### Cloud tiering
- If a tiered file is copied to another location by using Robocopy, the resulting file isn't tiered. The offline attribute might be set because Robocopy incorrectly includes that attribute in copy operations.
- When copying files using robocopy, use the /MIR option to preserve file timestamps. This will ensure older files are tiered sooner than recently accessed files.
    > [!Warning]  
    > Robocopy /B switch is not supported with Azure File Sync. Using the Robocopy /B switch with an Azure File Sync server endpoint as the source may lead to file corruption.
