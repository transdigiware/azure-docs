# Monitor Azure Cosmos DB data by using diagnostic settings in Azure
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-all-apis](includes/appliesto-all-apis.md)]

Diagnostic settings in Azure are used to collect resource logs. Azure resource Logs are emitted by a resource and provide rich, frequent data about the operation of that resource. These logs are captured per request and they are also referred to as "data plane logs". Some examples of the data plane operations include delete, insert, and readFeed. The content of these logs varies by resource type.

Platform metrics and the Activity logs are collected automatically, whereas you must create a diagnostic setting to collect resource logs or forward them outside of Azure Monitor. You can turn on diagnostic setting for Azure Cosmos DB accounts and send resource logs to the following sources:
- Log Analytics workspaces
  - Data sent to Log Analytics can be written into **Azure Diagnostics (legacy)** or **Resource-specific (preview)** tables 
- Event hub
- Storage Account
  
> [!NOTE]
> We recommend creating the diagnostic setting in resource-specific mode (for all APIs except Table API) [following our instructions for creating diagnostics setting via REST API](cosmosdb-monitor-resource-logs.md#create-diagnostic-setting). This option provides additional cost-optimizations with an improved view for handling data.

## <a id="create-setting-portal"></a> Create diagnostics settings via the Azure portal

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Navigate to your Azure Cosmos account. Open the **Diagnostic settings** pane under the **Monitoring section**, and then select **Add diagnostic setting** option.

3. In the **Diagnostic settings** pane, fill the form with your preferred categories.

### Choose log categories

   |Category  |API   | Definition  | Key Properties   |
   |---------|---------|---------|---------|
   |DataPlaneRequests     |  All APIs        |     Logs back-end requests as data plane operations which are requests executed to create, update, delete or retrieve data within the account.   |   `Requestcharge`, `statusCode`, `clientIPaddress`, `partitionID`, `resourceTokenPermissionId` `resourceTokenPermissionMode`      |
   |MongoRequests     |    Mongo    |   Logs user-initiated requests from the front end to serve requests to Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB. When you enable this category, make sure to disable DataPlaneRequests.      |  `Requestcharge`, `opCode`, `retryCount`, `piiCommandText`      |
   |CassandraRequests     |   Cassandra      |    Logs user-initiated requests from the front end to serve requests to Azure Cosmos DB's API for Cassandra. When you enable this category, make sure to disable DataPlaneRequests.     |     `operationName`, `requestCharge`, `piiCommandText`    |
   |GremlinRequests     |    Gremlin    |     Logs user-initiated requests from the front end to serve requests to Azure Cosmos DB's API for Gremlin. When you enable this category, make sure to disable DataPlaneRequests.    |   `operationName`, `requestCharge`, `piiCommandText`, `retriedDueToRateLimiting`       |
   |QueryRuntimeStatistics     |   SQL      |     This table details query operations executed against a SQL API account. By default, the query text and its parameters are obfuscated to avoid logging personal data with full text query logging available by request.    |    `databasename`, `partitionkeyrangeid`, `querytext`    |
   |PartitionKeyStatistics     |    All APIs     |   Logs the statistics of logical partition keys by representing the storage size (KB) of the partition keys. This table is useful when troubleshooting storage skews. This PartitionKeyStatistics log is only emitted if the following condition are true: <br/><ul><li> At least 1% of the documents have same logical partition key. </li><li> There are at least 100 such keys partition keys. </li><li> Out of all the keys, the top 3 keys with largest storage size are captured by the PartitionKeyStatistics log. </li></ul> If the previous conditions are not met, the partition key statistics data is not available. It's okay if the above conditions are not met for your account. |   `subscriptionId`, `regionName`, `partitionKey`, `sizeKB`      |
   |PartitionKeyRUConsumption     |   SQL API    |     Logs the aggregated per-second RU/s consumption of partition keys. This table is useful for troubleshooting hot partitions. Currently, Azure Cosmos DB reports partition keys for SQL API accounts only and for point read/write and stored procedure operations.   |     `subscriptionId`, `regionName`, `partitionKey`, `requestCharge`, `partitionKeyRangeId`   |
   |ControlPlaneRequests     |   All APIs       |    Logs details on control plane operations i.e. creating an account, adding or removing a region, updating account replication settings etc.     |    `operationName`, `httpstatusCode`, `httpMethod`, `region`       |
   |TableApiRequests     |   Table API    |     Logs user-initiated requests from the front end to serve requests to Azure Cosmos DB's API for Table. When you enable this category, make sure to disable DataPlaneRequests.       |    `operationName`, `requestCharge`, `piiCommandText`     |

4. Once you select your **Categories details**, then send your Logs to your preferred destination. If you're sending Logs to a **Log Analytics Workspace**, make sure to select **Resource specific** as the Destination table.

## <a id="create-diagnostic-setting"></a> Create diagnostic setting via REST API
Use the [Azure Monitor REST API](/rest/api/monitor/diagnosticsettings/createorupdate) for creating a diagnostic setting via the interactive console.
> [!Note]
> We recommend setting the **logAnalyticsDestinationType** property to **Dedicated** for enabling resource specific tables.

## Create diagnostic setting via Azure CLI
Use the [az monitor diagnostic-settings create](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings#az_monitor_diagnostic_settings_create) command to create a diagnostic setting with the Azure CLI. See the documentation for this command for descriptions of its parameters.

> [!Note]
> If you are using SQL API, we recommend setting the **export-to-resource-specific** property to **true**.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az monitor diagnostic-settings create --resource /subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts/ --name {DIAGNOSTIC_SETTING_NAME} --export-to-resource-specific true --logs '[{"category": "QueryRuntimeStatistics","categoryGroup": null,"enabled": true,"retentionPolicy": {"enabled": false,"days": 0}}]' --workspace /subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourcegroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_NAME}"
   ```
## <a id="full-text-query"></a> Enable full-text query for logging query text

> [!Note]
> Enabling this feature may result in additional logging costs, for pricing details visit [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/). It is recommended to disable this feature after troubleshooting.

Azure Cosmos DB provides advanced logging for detailed troubleshooting. By enabling full-text query, you’ll be able to view the deobfuscated query for all requests within your Azure Cosmos DB account.  You’ll also give permission for Azure Cosmos DB to access and surface this data in your logs. 

1. To enable this feature, navigate to the `Features` blade in your Cosmos DB account.
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-cosmos-db/full-text-query-features.png" alt-text="Navigate to Features blade":::

2. Select `Enable`, this setting will then be applied in the within the next few minutes. All newly ingested logs will have the full-text or PIICommand text for each request.
   
    :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-cosmos-db/select-enable-full-text.png" alt-text="Select enable full-text":::
