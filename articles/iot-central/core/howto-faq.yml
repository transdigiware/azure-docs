    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I get information about my application?
        answer: |
          You may need:
          
          - This information if you contact support.
          - The Azure subscription your application uses to locate billing information in the Azure portal.
          - The application's ID when you're working with the REST API.
          - The application's version to complete tasks such as adding a connector.
          
          To get information about your IoT Central application:
          
          1. Select the **Help** link on the top menu.
          
          1. Select **About your app**.
          
          1. The **About your app** page shows information about your application:

              Use the **Copy info** button to copy the information to the clipboard.
          
      - question: |
          How many IoT Central applications can I deploy in my subscription?
        answer: |
          Each Azure subscription has default quotas that could impact the scope of your IoT solution. Currently, IoT Central limits the number of applications you can deploy in a subscription to 10. If you need to increase this limit, contact [Microsoft support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).
          
      - question: |
          How do I transfer a device from IoT Hub to IoT Central?
        answer: |
          A device can connect to an IoT hub directly using a connection string or using the [Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](../../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md). IoT Central always uses DPS.
          
          To connect a device that was connected to IoT Hub to IoT Central, update the device with:
          
          - The Scope ID of the IoT Central application.
          - A key derived from the application's group SAS key or X.509 certificate.
          
          To learn more, see [Get connected to Azure IoT Central](concepts-get-connected.md)
          
          To interact with IoT Central, there must be a device template that models the device capabilities. To learn more, see [What are device templates?](concepts-device-templates.md).
          
      - question: |
          How do I check for credential issues if a device isn't connecting to my IoT Central application?
        answer: |
          The [Troubleshoot why data from your devices isn't showing up in Azure IoT Central](troubleshoot-connection.md) includes steps to diagnose connectivity issues for devices.
          
      - question: |
          How do I file a ticket with customer support?
        answer: |
          If you need help, you can file an [Azure support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support).
          
          For more information, including other support options, see [Azure IoT support and help options](../../iot-fundamentals/iot-support-help.md).
          
      - question: |
          How do I unblock a device?
        answer: |
          When a device is blocked, it can't send data to your IoT Central application. Blocked devices have a status of **Blocked** on the **Devices** page in your application. An operator must unblock the device before it can resume sending data:
          
          :::image type="content" source="media/howto-faq/blocked.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing blocked device":::
          
          When an operator unblocks a device the status returns to its previous value, **Registered** or **Provisioned**.
          
      - question: |
          How do I move from a free to a standard pricing plan?
        answer: |
          - Applications that use the free pricing plan are free for seven days before they expire. To avoid losing data, you can move them to a standard pricing plan at any time before they expire.
          - Applications that use a standard pricing plan are charged per device, with the first two devices free, per application.
          
          Learn more about pricing on the [Azure IoT Central pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-central/).
          
          In the pricing section, you can move your application from the free to a standard pricing plan.
          
          To complete this self-service process, follow these steps:
          
          1. Go to the **Pricing** page in the **Administration** section.
          
          1. Select the **Plan**
          
              :::image type="content" source="media/howto-faq/free-trial-billing.png" alt-text="Trial state":::
          
          1. Select the appropriate Azure Active Directory, and then the Azure subscription to use for your application that uses a paid plan.
          
          1. After you select **Save**, your application now uses a paid plan and you start getting billed.
          
          > [!Note]
          > By default, you are converted to a *Standard 2* pricing plan.
          
      - question: |
          How do I change my application pricing plan
        answer: |
          Applications that use a standard pricing plan are charged per device, with the first two devices free, per application.
          
          In the pricing section, you can upgrade or downgrade your Azure IoT pricing plan at any time.
          
          1. Go to the **Pricing** page in the **Administration** section.
          
              :::image type="content" source="media/howto-faq/pricing.png" alt-text="Upgrade pricing plan":::
          
          1. Select the **Plan** and then select **Save** to upgrade or downgrade.
          
      - question: |
          How do I approve a device?
        answer: |
          If the device status is **Waiting for Approval** on the **Devices** page, it means the **Auto approve** option is disabled:
          
          :::image type="content" source="media/howto-faq/auto-approve.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing application with auto-approve option disabled.":::
          
          An operator must explicitly approve a device before it starts sending data. Devices not registered manually on the **Devices** page, but connected with valid credentials will have the device status **Waiting for Approval**. Operators can approve these devices from the **Devices** page using the **Approve** button:
          
          :::image type="content" source="media/howto-faq/approve-device.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to approve a device":::
          
      - question: |
          How do I associate a device with a device template?
        answer: |
          If the device status is **Unassociated**, it means the device connecting to IoT Central doesn't have an associated device template. This situation typically happens in the following scenarios:
          
          - A set of devices is added using **Import** on the **Devices** page without specifying the device template.
          - A device was registered manually on the **Devices** page without specifying the device template. The device then connected with valid credentials.  
          
          The operator can associate a device to a device template from the **Devices** page using the **Migrate** button. To learn more, see [Manage devices in your Azure IoT Central application > Migrating devices to a template](howto-manage-devices-individually.md).
          
      - question: |
          Where can I learn more about IoT Hub?
        answer: |
          Azure IoT Central uses Azure IoT Hub as a cloud gateway that enables device connectivity. IoT Hub enables:
          
          - Data ingestion at scale in the cloud.
          - Device management.
          - Secure device connectivity.
          
          To learn more about IoT Hub, see [Azure IoT Hub](../../iot-hub/index.yml).
          
      - question: |
          Where can I learn more about the Device Provisioning Service (DPS)?
        answer: |
          Azure IoT Central uses DPS to enable devices to connect to your application. To learn more about the role DPS plays in connecting devices to IoT Central, see [Get connected to Azure IoT Central](concepts-get-connected.md). To learn more about DPS, see [Provisioning devices with Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service](../../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md).
