# Migrate confidential client applications from ADAL.NET to MSAL.NET

This article describes how to migrate a confidential client application from Azure Active Directory Authentication Library for .NET (ADAL.NET) to Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET (MSAL.NET). Confidential client applications are web apps, web APIs, and daemon applications that call another service on their own behalf. For more information about confidential applications, see [Authentication flows and application scenarios](authentication-flows-app-scenarios.md). If your app is based on ASP.NET Core, use [Microsoft.Identity.Web](microsoft-identity-web.md).

For app registrations:

- You don't need to create a new app registration. (You keep the same client ID.)
- You don't need to change the preauthorizations (admin-consented API permissions).

## Migration steps

1. Find the code by using ADAL.NET in your app.

   The code that uses ADAL in a confidential client application instantiates `AuthenticationContext` and calls either `AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCode` or one override of `AcquireTokenAsync` with the following parameters:

   - A `resourceId` string. This variable is the app ID URI of the web API that you want to call.
   - An instance of `IClientAssertionCertificate` or `ClientAssertion`. This instance provides the client credentials for your app to prove the identity of your app.

1. After you've identified that you have apps that are using ADAL.NET, install the MSAL.NET NuGet package [Microsoft.Identity.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client) and update your project library references. For more information, see [Install a NuGet package](https://www.bing.com/search?q=install+nuget+package).

1. Update the code according to the confidential client scenario. Some steps are common and apply across all the confidential client scenarios. Other steps are unique to each scenario. 

   The confidential client scenarios are:

   - [Daemon scenarios](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-migration-confidential-client?tabs=daemon#migrate-daemon-scenarios) supported by web apps, web APIs, and daemon console applications.
   - [Web API calling downstream web APIs](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-migration-confidential-client?tabs=obo#migrate-on-behalf-of-calls-obo-in-web-apis) supported by web APIs calling downstream web APIs on behalf of the user.
   - [Web app calling web APIs](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-migration-confidential-client?tabs=authcode#migrate-acquiretokenbyauthorizationcodeasync-in-web-apps) supported by web apps that sign in users and call a downstream web API.

You might have provided a wrapper around ADAL.NET to handle certificates and caching. This article uses the same approach to illustrate the process of migrating from ADAL.NET to MSAL.NET. However, this code is only for demonstration purposes. Don't copy/paste these wrappers or integrate them in your code as they are.

## [Daemon](#tab/daemon)

### Migrate daemon apps

Daemon scenarios use the OAuth2.0 [client credential flow](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md). They're also called service-to-service calls. Your app acquires a token on its own behalf, not on behalf of a user.

#### Find out if your code uses daemon scenarios

The ADAL code for your app uses daemon scenarios if it contains a call to `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync` with the following parameters:

- A resource (app ID URI) as a first parameter
- `IClientAssertionCertificate` or `ClientAssertion` as the second parameter

`AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync` doesn't have a parameter of type `UserAssertion`. If it does, then your app is a web API, and it's using the [web API calling downstream web APIs ](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-migration-confidential-client?#migrate-on-behalf-of-calls-obo-in-web-apis) scenario.

#### Update the code of daemon scenarios

[!INCLUDE [Common steps](includes/msal-net-adoption-steps-confidential-clients.md)]

In this case, we replace the call to `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync` with a call to `IConfidentialClientApplication.AcquireTokenClient`.

Here's a comparison of ADAL.NET and MSAL.NET code for daemon scenarios:

#### Benefit from token caching

To benefit from the in-memory cache, the instance of `IConfidentialClientApplication` needs to be kept in a member variable. If you re-create the confidential client application each time you request a token, you won't benefit from the token cache.

You'll need to serialize `AppTokenCache` if you choose not to use the default in-memory app token cache. Similarly, If you want to implement a distributed token cache, you'll need to serialize `AppTokenCache`. For details, see [Token cache for a web app or web API (confidential client application)](msal-net-token-cache-serialization.md?tabs=aspnet) and the sample [active-directory-dotnet-v1-to-v2/ConfidentialClientTokenCache](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-v1-to-v2/tree/master/ConfidentialClientTokenCache).

## [Web API calling downstream web APIs](#tab/obo)

### Migrate a web API that calls downstream web APIs

Web APIs that call downstream web APIs use the OAuth2.0 [on-behalf-of (OBO)](v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow.md) flow. The code of the web API uses the token retrieved from the HTTP authorized header and validates it. This token is exchanged against a token to call the downstream web API. This token is used as a `UserAssertion` instance in both ADAL.NET and MSAL.NET.

#### Find out if your code uses OBO

The ADAL code for your app uses OBO if it contains a call to `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync` with the following parameters:

- A resource (app ID URI) as a first parameter
- `IClientAssertionCertificate` or `ClientAssertion` as the second parameter
- A parameter of type `UserAssertion`

#### Update the code by using OBO

[!INCLUDE [Common steps](includes/msal-net-adoption-steps-confidential-clients.md)]

In this case, we replace the call to `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync` with a call to `IConfidentialClientApplication.AcquireTokenOnBehalfOf`.

#### Benefit from token caching

For token caching in OBOs, you need to use a distributed token cache. For details, see [Token cache for a web app or web API (confidential client application)](msal-net-token-cache-serialization.md?tabs=aspnet) and read through [sample code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-v1-to-v2/tree/master/ConfidentialClientTokenCache).

```CSharp
app.UseInMemoryTokenCaches(); // or a distributed token cache.
```

## [Web app calling web APIs](#tab/authcode)

### Migrate a web app that calls web APIs

If your app uses ASP.NET Core, we strongly recommend that you update to Microsoft.Identity.Web, which processes everything for you. For a quick presentation, see the [Microsoft.Identity.Web announcement of general availability](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki/1.0.0). For details about how to use it in a web app, see [Why use Microsoft.Identity.Web in web apps?](https://aka.ms/ms-id-web/webapp).

Web apps that sign in users and call web APIs on behalf of users use the OAuth2.0 [authorization code flow](v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md). Typically:

1. The web app signs in a user by executing a first leg of the authorization code flow. It does this by going to the authorize endpoint in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The user signs in and performs multifactor authentications if needed. As an outcome of this operation, the app receives the authorization code. So far, ADAL and MSAL aren't involved.
2. The app executes the second leg of the authorization code flow. It uses the authorization code to get an access token, an ID token, and a refresh token. Your application needs to provide the `redirectUri` value, which is the URI at which Azure AD will provide the security tokens. After the app receives that URI, it typically calls `AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCode` for ADAL or MSAL to redeem the code and to get a token that will be stored in the token cache.
3. The app uses ADAL or MSAL to call `AcquireTokenSilent` so that it can get tokens for calling the necessary web APIs. This is done from the web app controllers.

#### Find out if your code uses the auth code flow

The ADAL code for your app uses auth code flow if it contains a call to `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCodeAsync`.

#### Update the code by using the authorization code flow

[!INCLUDE [Common steps](includes/msal-net-adoption-steps-confidential-clients.md)] 

In this case, we replace the call to `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync` with a call to `IConfidentialClientApplication.AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCode`.

Calling `AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCode` adds a token to the token cache. To acquire extra tokens for other resources or tenants, use `AcquireTokenSilent` in your controllers.

#### Benefit from token caching

Because your web app uses `AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCode`, your app needs to use a distributed token cache for token caching. For details, see [Token cache for a web app or web API](msal-net-token-cache-serialization.md?tabs=aspnet) and read through [sample code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-v1-to-v2/tree/master/ConfidentialClientTokenCache).


```CSharp
app.UseInMemoryTokenCaches(); // or a distributed token cache.
```

## MSAL benefits

Key benefits of MSAL.NET for your app include:

- **Resilience**. MSAL.NET helps make your app resilient through the following:

   - Azure AD Cached Credential Service (CCS) benefits. CCS operates as an Azure AD backup.
   - Proactive renewal of tokens if the API that you call enables long-lived tokens through [continuous access evaluation](app-resilience-continuous-access-evaluation.md).

- **Security**. You can acquire Proof of Possession (PoP) tokens if the web API that you want to call requires it. For details, see [Proof Of Possession tokens in MSAL.NET](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Proof-Of-Possession-(PoP)-tokens)

- **Performance and scalability**. If you don't need to share your cache with ADAL.NET, disable the legacy cache compatibility when you're creating the confidential client application (`.WithLegacyCacheCompatibility(false)`). This increases the performance significantly.
  
  ```csharp
  app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(ClientId)
          .WithCertificate(certificate)
          .WithAuthority(authority)
          .WithLegacyCacheCompatibility(false)
          .Build();
  ```

## Troubleshooting

The following troubleshooting information makes two assumptions: 

- Your ADAL.NET code was working.
- You migrated to MSAL by keeping the same client ID.

If you get an exception with either of the following messages: 

> `AADSTS700027: Client assertion contains an invalid signature. [Reason - The key was not found.]`

> `AADSTS90002: Tenant 'cf61953b-e41a-46b3-b500-663d279ea744' not found. This may happen if there are no active`
> `subscriptions for the tenant. Check to make sure you have the correct tenant ID. Check with your subscription`
> `administrator.`

You can troubleshoot the exception by using these steps:

1. Confirm that you're using the latest version of MSAL.NET.
1. Confirm that the authority host that you set when building the confidential client application and the authority host that you used with ADAL are similar. In particular, is it the same [cloud](msal-national-cloud.md) (Azure Government, Azure China 21Vianet, or Azure Germany)?
