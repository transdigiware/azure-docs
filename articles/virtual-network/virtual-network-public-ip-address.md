# Create, change, or delete an Azure public IP address

Learn about a public IP address and how to create, change, and delete one. A public IP address is a resource with configurable settings. Assigning a public IP address to an Azure resource that supports public IP addresses enables:

- Inbound communication from the Internet to the resource, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), Azure Application Gateways, Azure Load Balancers, Azure VPN Gateways, and others.
- Outbound connectivity to the Internet using a predictable IP address.

[!INCLUDE [ephemeral-ip-note.md](../../includes/ephemeral-ip-note.md)]

## Create a public IP address

For instructions on how to create public IP addresses using the Portal, PowerShell, CLI, or Resource Manager templates, refer to the following pages:

 * [Create public IP addresses - Portal](./create-public-ip-portal.md?tabs=option-create-public-ip-standard-zones)
 * [Create public IP addresses - PowerShell](./create-public-ip-powershell.md?tabs=option-create-public-ip-standard-zones)
 * [Create public IP addresses - Azure CLI](./create-public-ip-cli.md?tabs=option-create-public-ip-standard-zones)
 * [Create public IP addresses - Template](./create-public-ip-template.md)

>[!NOTE]
>Though the portal provides the option to create two public IP address resources (one IPv4 and one IPv6), the PowerShell and CLI commands create one resource with an address for one IP version or the other. If you want two public IP address resources, one for each IP version, you must run the command twice, specifying different names and IP versions for the public IP address resources.

For more detail on the specific attributes of a public IP address during creation, see the following table:

   |Setting|Required?|Details|
   |---|---|---|
   |IP Version|Yes| Select IPv4 or IPv6 or Both. Selecting Both will result in 2 Public IP addresses being create- 1 IPv4 address and 1 IPv6 address. Learn more about [IPv6 in Azure VNETs](../virtual-network/ipv6-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).|
   |SKU|Yes|All public IP addresses created before the introduction of SKUs are **Basic** SKU public IP addresses. You cannot change the SKU after the public IP address is created. A standalone virtual machine, virtual machines within an availability set, or virtual machine scale sets can use Basic or Standard SKUs. Mixing SKUs between virtual machines within availability sets or scale sets or standalone VMs is not allowed. **Basic** SKU: If you are creating a public IP address in a region that supports availability zones, the **Availability zone** setting is set to *None* by default. Basic Public IPs do not support Availability zones. **Standard** SKU: A Standard SKU public IP can be associated to a virtual machine or a load balancer front end. If you're creating a public IP address in a region that supports availability zones, the **Availability zone** setting is set to *Zone-redundant* by default. For more information about availability zones, see the **Availability zone** setting. The standard SKU is required if you associate the address to a Standard load balancer. To learn more about standard load balancers, see [Azure load balancer standard SKU](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). When you assign a standard SKU public IP address to a virtual machine's network interface, you must explicitly allow the intended traffic with a [network security group](./network-security-groups-overview.md#network-security-groups). Communication with the resource fails until you create and associate a network security group and explicitly allow the desired traffic.|
   |Tier|Yes|Indicates if the IP address is associated with a region (**Regional**) or is "anycast" from multiple regions (**Global**). *Note that a "Global Tier" IP is preview functionality for Standard IPs, and currently only utilized for the Cross-Region Load Balancer*.|
   |Name|Yes|The name must be unique within the resource group you select.|
   |IP address assignment|Yes|**Dynamic:** Dynamic addresses are assigned after a public IP address is associated to an Azure resource and is started for the first time. Dynamic addresses can change if a resource such as a virtual machine is stopped (deallocated) and then restarted. The address remains the same if a virtual machine is rebooted or stopped. When a public IP address resource is removed from a resource, the dynamic address is released.<br> **Static:** Static addresses are assigned when a public IP address is created. Static addresses aren't released until a public IP address resource is deleted. <br>Note: If you select *IPv6* for the **IP version**, the assignment method must be *Dynamic* for Basic SKU.  Standard SKU addresses are *Static* for both IPv4 and IPv6. |
  |Routing preference |Yes| By default, the routing preference for public IP addresses is set to "Microsoft network", which delivers traffic over Microsoft's global wide area network to the user.  The selection of "Internet" minimizes travel on Microsoft's network, instead using the transit ISP network to deliver traffic at a cost-optimized rate.  A public IP addresses routing preference canâ€™t be changed once created.  For more information on routing preference, see [What is routing preference (preview)?](./routing-preference-overview.md).   |
   |Idle timeout (minutes)|No|How many minutes to keep a TCP or HTTP connection open without relying on clients to send keep-alive messages. If you select IPv6 for **IP Version**, this value is set to 4 minutes and cannot be changed. |
   |DNS name label|No|Must be unique within the Azure location you create the name in (across all subscriptions and all customers). Azure automatically registers the name and IP address in its DNS so you can connect to a resource with the name. Azure appends a default subnet such as *location.cloudapp.azure.com* to the name you provide to create the fully qualified DNS name. If you choose to create both address versions, the same DNS name is assigned to both the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Azure's default DNS contains both IPv4 A and IPv6 AAAA name records. The default DNS responds with both records during DNS lookup. The client chooses which address (IPv4 or IPv6) to communicate with. You can use the Azure DNS service to configure a DNS name with a custom suffix that resolves to the public IP address. For more information, see [Use Azure DNS with an Azure public IP address](../dns/dns-custom-domain.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#public-ip-address).|
   |Name (Only visible if you select IP Version of **Both**)|Yes, if you select IP Version of **Both**|The name must be different than the name you enter for the first **Name** in this list. If you choose to create both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, the portal creates two separate public IP address resources, one with each IP address version assigned to it.|
   |IP address assignment (Only visible if you select IP Version of **Both**)|Yes, if you select IP Version of **Both**| Same restrictions as IP address assignment above. |
   |Subscription|Yes|Must exist in the same [subscription](../azure-glossary-cloud-terminology.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#subscription) as the resource to which you'll associate the public IPs.|
   |Resource group|Yes|Can exist in the same, or different, [resource group](../azure-glossary-cloud-terminology.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#resource-group) as the resource to which you'll associate the public IPs.|
   |Location|Yes|Must exist in the same [location](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions), also referred to as region, as the resource to which you'll associate the Public IPs.|
   |Availability zone| No | This setting only appears if you select a supported location and IP address type. **Basic** SKU public IPs and **Global** Tier public IPs don't support Availability Zones. You can select no-zone (default option), a specific zone, or zone-redundant. The choice will depend on your specific domain failure requirements. For a list of supported locations and more information about Availability Zones, see [Availability zones overview](../availability-zones/az-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).  

## View, modify settings for, or delete a public IP address

   - **View/List**: Review settings for a public IP, including the SKU, address, and any association. Associations can be load balancer front-ends, virtual machines, and other Azure resources.
   - **Modify**: Modify settings using the information in [create a public IP address](#create-a-public-ip-address). Settings such as the idle timeout, DNS name label, or assignment method. For the full process of upgrading a public IP SKU from basic to standard, see [Upgrade Azure public IP addresses](./public-ip-upgrade-portal.md).
   
   >[!WARNING]
   >Remove the address from any applicable IP configurations (see **Delete** section) to change assignment for a public IP from static to dynamic. When you change the assignment method from static to dynamic, you lose the IP address that was assigned to the public IP resource. While the Azure public DNS servers maintain a mapping between static or dynamic addresses and any DNS name label (if you defined one), a dynamic IP address can change when the virtual machine is started after being in the stopped (deallocated) state. To prevent the address from changing, assign a static IP address.

Use [Remove-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/remove-azpublicipaddress) to delete a public IP. You can also use [az network lb frontend-ip delete](/cli/azure/network/lb/frontend-ip#az_network_lb_frontend_ip_delete) to remove a frontend IP config if there are more than one. |
|Firewall|N/A| [Deallocate](../firewall/firewall-faq.yml#how-can-i-stop-and-start-azure-firewall) to deallocate firewall and remove all IP configurations | Use [az network firewall ip-config delete](/cli/azure/network/firewall/ip-config#az_network_firewall_ip_config_delete) to remove IP. Use PowerShell to deallocate first. |

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets

When using a virtual machine scale set with Public IPs, there are not separate Public IP objects associated with the individual virtual machine instances. However, a Public IP Prefix object [can be used to generate the instance IPs](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/vmms-with-public-ip-prefix/).

To list the Public IPs on a virtual machine scale set, you can use PowerShell ([Get-AzPublicIpAddress -VirtualMachineScaleSetName](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress)) or CLI ([az virtual machine scale set list-instance-public-ips](/cli/azure/vmss#az_vmss_list_instance_public_ips)).

For more information, see [Networking for Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-networking.md#public-ipv4-per-virtual-machine).

## Permissions

To manage public IP addresses, your account must be assigned to the [network contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) role. A [custom](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) role is also supported. The custom role must be assigned the appropriate actions listed in the following table:

| Action                                                             | Name                                                           |
