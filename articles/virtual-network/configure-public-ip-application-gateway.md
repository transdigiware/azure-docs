# Manage a public IP address with an Azure Application Gateway

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that manages traffic to your web applications. Application Gateway makes routing decisions based on attributes of an HTTP request. Examples of attributes such as URI path or host headers.  The frontend of an Application Gateway is the connection point for the applications in its backend pool. 

An Application Gateway frontend can be a private IP address, public IP address, or both.  The V1 SKU of Application Gateway supports basic public IPs, static, or dynamic.  The V2 SKU supports standard SKU public IPs that are static only. Application Gateway V2 SKU doesn't support an internal IP address as it's only frontend.  For more information, see [Application Gateway front-end IP address configuration](../application-gateway/configuration-front-end-ip.md).  

In this article, you'll learn how to create an Application Gateway using an existing public IP in your subscription. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
- Two standard SKU public IP addresses in your subscription. The IP addresses can't be associated with any resources. For more information on creating a standard SKU public IP address, see [Create a public IP - Azure portal](create-public-ip-portal.md).
    - For the purposes of the examples in this article, name the new public IP addresses **myStandardPublicIP-1** and **myStandardPublicIP-2**.

## Create Application Gateway existing public IP

In this section, you'll create an Application Gateway resource. You'll select the IP address you created in the prerequisites as the public IP for the Application Gateway.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Application gateway**.

3. In the search results, select **Application gateways**.

4. Select **+ Create**.

5. In **Create application gateway**, enter or select the following information.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**.<ul><li>Enter **myResourceGroupAppGW**.</li></ul>Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | Application gateway name | Enter **myAppGateway**. |
    | Region | Select **(US) West US 2**. |
    | Tier | Leave the default of **Standard V2**. |
    | Enable autoscaling | Leave the default of **Yes**. |
    | Minimum instance count | Leave the default of **0**. |
    | Maximum instance count | Leave the default of **10**. |
    | Availability zone | Leave the default of **None**. |
    | HTTP2 | Leave the default of **Disabled**. |
    | Virtual network | Select **Create new**. <ul><li>In **Create virtual network**, enter **myVNet** for name.</li><li>Leave the default address space in **ADDRESS SPACE**.</li><li>In **SUBNETS**, change **default** to **myAGSubnet**.</li><li>In the second subnet name, enter **myBackendSubnet**.</li><li>In **Address range**, enter a range within the default address space.</li></ul>Select **OK**.|

6. Select **Next: Frontends**.

7. Select **myStandardPublicIP-1** for **Public IP address** in the **Frontends** tab, or your public IP address.

8. Select **Next: Backends**. 

9. Select **Add a backend pool**.

10. Enter **myBackendPool** for name in **Add a backend pool**.

11. Select **Next: Configuration**.

12. Select **+ Add a routing rule**. Enter or select the following information.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Rule name | Enter **myRoutingRule**. |
    | **Listener** |    |
    | Listener name | Enter **myListener**. |
    | Frontend IP | Select **Public**. |
    | Frontend IP Protocol | Leave the default of **HTTP**. |
    | Port | Leave the default of **80**. |
    | **Additional settings** |   |
    | Listener type | Leave the default of **Basic**. |
    | Error page url | Leave the default of **No**. |
    | **Backend targets** |    |
    | Target type | Leave the default of **Backend pool**. |
    | Backend target | Select **myBackendPool**. |
    | HTTP settings | Select **Add new**.<ul><li>Enter **myHTTPsetting** in **Name**.</li><li>Leave the other settings at the defaults.</li></ul>Select **Add**.|

13. Select **Add**.

14. Select **Next: Tags**, then **Next: Review + create**.

15. Select **Create**.

## Change or remove public IP address

Application gateway doesn't support changing the public IP address after creation.

## More information

* If a dynamic Basic SKU IP is associated with an Application Gateway frontend, it only changes when the gateway is stopped or started. The DNS name associated with an Application Gateway frontend doesn't change. 

## Caveats

* Public IPv6 addresses aren't supported on Application Gateways at this time.
