# Quickstart: Step-by-step instructions to create a new HoloLens Unity app using Azure Object Anchors

This quickstart will show you how to create a new HoloLens Unity app with [Azure Object Anchors](../overview.md). Azure
Object Anchors is a managed cloud service that converts 3D assets into AI models that enable object-aware mixed
reality experiences for the HoloLens. When you're finished, you'll have a HoloLens app built with Unity that can detect
objects in the physical world.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, make sure you have:

* All prerequisites from either the [Unity HoloLens](get-started-unity-hololens.md) or the [Unity HoloLens with MRTK](get-started-unity-hololens-mrtk.md) quickstarts.
* <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank">Unity Hub with Unity 2020.3.8f1 or newer</a>

## Getting started

We'll first set up our project and Unity scene:

1. Start Unity Hub.
1. Select **New**, picking Unity 2020.3.8f1 or newer.
1. Ensure **3D** is selected.
1. Name your project and enter a save **Location**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Once **Unity Editor** opens up, save the empty default scene to a new file using: **File** > **Save As**.
1. Select the **Scenes** folder, name the new scene **Main**, and press the **Save** button.

## Configure as UWP

1. Select **File -> Building Settings**.
1. Select **Universal Windows Platform** and then select **Switch Platform**.
1. If Unity Editor says you need to download some components first, download and install them.

## Install Mixed Reality Feature Tool feature packages

1. Follow the <a a href="/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool" target="_blank">Mixed Reality Feature Tool</a> documentation to set up the tool and learn how to use it.
1. Under the **Platform Support** section, install the **Mixed Reality OpenXR Plugin** feature package, version 1.0.0 or newer, into the Unity project folder.
1. Under the **Azure Mixed Reality Services** section, install the **Microsoft Azure Object Anchors** feature package, into the Unity project folder.
1. Go back to your **Unity Editor**. It might take a few minutes, while the **Mixed Reality Feature Tool** feature packages are installed.
1. You'll see a dialog asking for confirmation to enable the new input system.
1. Select the **Yes** button.
1. Once the install process completes, Unity will restart automatically.

## Configure OpenXR

1. You should still be inside the **Build Settings** window.
1. Select the **Player settings...** button.
1. The **Project Settings** window will open up.
1. Select the **XR Plug-in Management** entry.
1. Follow the <a href="/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/xr-project-setup#configuring-xr-plugin-management-for-openxr" target="_blank">Configuring XR Plugin Management for OpenXR</a> documentation to set up the **OpenXR** with **Microsoft HoloLens feature set** in the **Plug-in Providers** list.

## Set capabilities

1. You should still be inside the **Project Settings** window.
1. Select the **Player** entry.
1. In the **Inspector Panel** for **Player Settings**, ensure the **Universal Windows Platform settings** icon is selected.
1. In the **Publishing Settings** Capabilities section, ensure that **InternetClientServer**, **WebCam**, and **SpatialPerception** are selected.

## Set up the project settings

1. You should still be inside the **Project Settings** window.
1. Select the **Quality** entry.
1. In the column under the **Universal Windows Platform** logo, select on the arrow at the **Default** row and select **Very Low**. You'll know the setting is applied correctly when the box in the **Universal Windows Platform** column and **Very Low** row is green.
1. Close the **Project Settings** and the **Build Settings** windows.
1. Follow the <a href="/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/xr-project-setup#optimization" target="_blank">Optimization</a> documentation to apply the recommended project settings for HoloLens 2.

## Set up the main virtual camera

1. In the **Hierarchy** pane, select **Main Camera**.
1. In the **Inspector**, set its transform position to **0,0,0**.
1. Find the **Clear Flags** property, and change the dropdown from **Skybox** to **Solid Color**.
1. Select the **Background** field to open the color picker.
1. Set **R, G, B, and A** to **0**.
1. Change the **Clipping Planes Near** property to 0.1.
1. Select **Add Component** and search for and add the **Tracked Pose Driver**.
1. Select  **File** > **Save**.

## Trying it out

To test out that everything is working, build your app in **Unity** and deploy it from **Visual Studio**. Follow Chapter 6 from the <a href="/windows/mixed-reality/holograms-100#chapter-6---build-and-deploy-to-device-from-visual-studio" target="_blank">**MR Basics 100: Getting started with Unity** course</a> to do so. You should see the Unity start screen, and then a clear display.

## Create your script

1. In the **Project** pane, create a new folder, **Scripts**, under the **Assets** folder.
1. Right-click on the folder, then select **Create >**, **C# Script**. Name it **ObjectSearch**.
1. Go to **GameObject** -> **Create Empty**.
1. Select it, and in the **Inspector** rename it from **GameObject** to **Object Observer**.
1. Select **Add Component** and search for and add the **ObjectSearch** script.
1. Select  **File** > **Save**.

## Start implementing your app

You're ready to start adding your own code to the **ObjectSearch** script, using the Object Anchors Runtime SDK. You can reference the [SDK overview](../concepts/sdk-overview.md) as a starting point to learn the basics, and use some of the sample code to try it out.
