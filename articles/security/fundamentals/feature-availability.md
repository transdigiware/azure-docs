# Cloud feature availability for US Government customers

This article describes feature availability in the Microsoft Azure and Azure Government clouds for the following security services:

- [Azure Sentinel](#azure-sentinel)
- [Azure Security Center](#azure-security-center)

> [!NOTE]
> Additional security services will be added to this article soon.
> 

## Azure Government

Azure Government uses the same underlying technologies as Azure (sometimes referred to as Azure Commercial or Azure Public), which includes the core components of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Both Azure and Azure Government have comprehensive security controls in place, and the Microsoft commitment on the safeguarding of customer data.

Azure Government is a physically isolated cloud environment dedicated to US federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and their partners. Whereas both cloud environments are assessed and authorized at the FedRAMP High impact level, Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data to screened US persons. These commitments may be of interest to customers using the cloud to store or process data subject to US export control regulations such as the EAR, ITAR, and DoE 10 CFR Part 810.

For more information about Azure Government, see [What is Azure Government?](../../azure-government/documentation-government-welcome.md)

## Microsoft 365 integration

Integrations between products rely on interoperability between Azure and Office platforms. Offerings hosted in the Azure environment are accessible from the Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Government platforms. Office 365 and Office 365 GCC are paired with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in Azure. Office 365 GCC High and Office 365 DoD are paired with Azure AD in Azure Government.

The following diagram displays the hierarchy of Microsoft clouds and how they relate to each other.

The Office 365 GCC environment helps customers comply with US government requirements, including FedRAMP High, CJIS, and IRS 1075. The Office 365 GCC High and DoD environments support customers who need compliance with DoD IL4/5, DFARS 7012, NIST 800-171, and ITAR.

For more information about Office 365 US Government environments, see:

- [Office 365 GCC](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc)
- [Office 365 GCC High and DoD](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod)


The following sections identify when a service has an integration with Microsoft 365 and the feature availability for Office 365 GCC, Office 365 High, and Office 365 DoD.

## Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers, and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud - whether they're in Azure or not - as well as on premises.

For more information, see the [Azure Security Center product documentation](../../security-center/security-center-introduction.md).

The following table displays the current Security Center feature availability in Azure and Azure Government.

## Azure Sentinel

Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM), and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Azure Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

For more information, see the [Azure Sentinel product documentation](../../sentinel/overview.md).

### Microsoft 365 data connectors

Office 365 GCC is paired with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in Azure. Office 365 GCC High and Office 365 DoD are paired with Azure AD in Azure Government.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to pay attention to the Azure environment to understand where [interoperability is possible](#microsoft-365-integration). In the following table, interoperability that is *not* possible is marked with a dash (-) to indicate that support is not relevant.

## Azure Defender for IoT 

Azure Defender for IoT lets you accelerate IoT/OT innovation with comprehensive security across all your IoT/OT devices. For end-user organizations, Azure Defender for IoT offers agentless, network-layer security that is rapidly deployed, works with diverse industrial equipment, and interoperates with Azure Sentinel and other SOC tools. Deploy on-premises or in Azure-connected environments. For IoT device builders, the Azure Defender for IoT security agents allow you to build security directly into your new IoT devices and Azure IoT projects. The micro agent has flexible deployment options, including the ability to deploy as a binary package or modify source code. And the micro agent is available for standard IoT operating systems like Linux and Azure RTOS. For more information, see the [Azure Defender for IoT product documentation](../../defender-for-iot/index.yml). 

The following table displays the current Azure Defender for IoT feature availability in Azure, and Azure Government.

## Next steps

- Understand the [shared responsibility](shared-responsibility.md) model and which security tasks are handled by the cloud provider and which tasks are handled by you.
- Understand the [Azure Government Cloud](../../azure-government/documentation-government-welcome.md) capabilities and the trustworthy design and security used to support compliance applicable to federal, state, and local government organizations and their partners.
- Understand the [Office 365 Government plan](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/office-365-us-government#about-office-365-government-environments).
- Understand [compliance in Azure](../../compliance/index.yml) for legal and regulatory standards.
