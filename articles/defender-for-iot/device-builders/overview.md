# Welcome to Azure Defender for IoT for device builders

Security is a near-universal concern for IoT implementers. IoT devices have unique needs for endpoint monitoring, security posture management, and threat detection â€“ all with highly specific performance requirements. 

The Azure Defender for IoT security agents allow you to build security directly into your new IoT devices and Azure IoT projects. The micro agent has flexible deployment options, including the ability to deploy as a binary package or modify source code. And the micro agent is available for standard IoT operating systems like Linux and Azure RTOS.  

The Azure Defender for IoT micro agent provides endpoint visibility into security posture management, threat detection, and integration into Microsoft's other security tools for unified security management. 

## Security posture management

Proactively monitor the security posture of your IoT devices. Azure Defender for IoT provides security posture recommendations based on the CIS benchmark, along with device-specific recommendations. Get visibility into operating system security, including OS configuration, firewall configuration, and permissions. 

## Endpoint IoT/OT threat detection

Detect threats like botnets, brute force attempts, crypto miners, and suspicious network activity. Create custom alerts to target the most important threats in your unique organization. 

## Flexible distribution and deployment models 

The Azure Defender for IoT micro agent includes source code, so you can incorporate the micro agent into firmware or customize it to include only what you need. It's also available as a binary package, or integrated directly into other Azure IoT solutions.
