# Quickstart: Get started with Azure Video Analyzer in the Azure portal

This quickstart walks you through the steps to get started with Azure Video Analyzer. You'll create an Azure Video Analyzer account and its accompanying resources by using the Azure portal. You'll then deploy the Video Analyzer edge module and a Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) camera simulator module to your Azure IoT Edge device.

After you complete the setup steps, you'll be able to run the simulated live video stream through a pipeline that detects and reports any motion in that stream. The following diagram graphically represents that pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure subscription. If you don't have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

  [!INCLUDE [the video analyzer account and storage account must be in the same subscription and region](./includes/note-account-storage-same-subscription.md)]

- An IoT Edge device on which you have admin privileges:
  - [Deploy to an IoT Edge device](deploy-iot-edge-device.md)
  - [Deploy to an IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](deploy-iot-edge-linux-on-windows.md)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with the [Azure IoT Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools) extension.

[!INCLUDE [install-docker-prompt](./includes/common-includes/install-docker-prompt.md)]

## Prepare your IoT Edge device

The Azure Video Analyzer module should be configured to run on the IoT Edge device with a non-privileged local user account. The module needs certain local folders for storing application configuration data. The RTSP camera simulator module needs video files with which it can synthesize a live video feed.

Run the following command on your IoT Edge device:

`bash -c "$(curl -sL https://aka.ms/ava-edge/prep_device)"`

The prep-device script in that command automates the tasks of creating input and configuration folders, downloading video input files, and creating user accounts with correct privileges. After the command finishes successfully, you should see the following folders created on your edge device:

- _/home/localedgeuser/samples_
- _/home/localedgeuser/samples/input_
- _/var/lib/videoanalyzer_
- _/var/media_

The video (_.mkv) files in the _/home/localedgeuser/samples/input\* folder are used to simulate live video.

## Create Azure resources

The next step is to create the required Azure resources (Video Analyzer account, storage account, and user-assigned managed identity). Then you can create an optional container registry and register a Video Analyzer edge module with the Video Analyzer account.

When you create an Azure Video Analyzer account, you have to associate an Azure storage account with it. If you use Video Analyzer to record the live video from a camera, that data is stored as blobs in a container in the storage account. You must use a managed identity to grant the Video Analyzer account the appropriate access to the storage account as follows.

[!INCLUDE [the video analyzer account and storage account must be in the same subscription and region](./includes/note-account-storage-same-subscription.md)]

### Create a Video Analyzer account in the Azure portal

1. Sign in at the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. On the search bar at the top, enter **Video Analyzer**.
1. Select **Video Analyzers** under **Services**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. In the **Create Video Analyzer account** section, enter these required values:

   - **Subscription**: Choose the subscription that you're using to create the Video Analyzer account.
   - **Resource group**: Choose a resource group where you're creating the Video Analyzer account, or select **Create new** to create a resource group.
   - **Video Analyzer account name**: Enter a name for your Video Analyzer account. The name must be all lowercase letters or numbers with no spaces, and 3 to 24 characters in length.
   - **Location**: Choose a location to deploy your Video Analyzer account (for example, **West US 2**).
   - **Storage account**: Create a storage account. We recommend that you select a [standard general-purpose v2](../../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md#types-of-storage-accounts) storage account.
   - **User identity**: Create and name a new user-assigned managed identity.

1. Select **Review + create** at the bottom of the form.

### Create a container registry

1. Select **Create a resource** > **Containers** > **Container Registry**.
1. On the **Basics** tab, enter values for **Resource group** and **Registry name**. Use the same resource group from the previous sections. The registry name must be unique within Azure and contain 5 to 50 alphanumeric characters.
1. Accept default values for the remaining settings. Then select **Review + create**. After you review the settings, select **Create**.

## Deploy edge modules

     }
   }
   ```
1. Select **Add** at the bottom of your screen.
1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create** to deploy your **rtspsim** edge module.

### Verify your deployment

On the device details page, verify that the **avaedge** and **rtspsim** modules are listed as both **Specified in Deployment** and **Reported by Device**.

It might take a few moments for the modules to be started on the device and then reported back to IoT Hub. Refresh the page to see an updated status. Status code **200 -- OK** means that [the IoT Edge runtime](../../iot-edge/iot-edge-runtime.md) is healthy and is operating fine.

![Screenshot that shows a status value for an IoT Edge runtime.](./media/deploy-iot-edge-device/status.png)

## Set up your development environment

### Obtain your IoT Hub connection string

1. In the Azure portal, go to your IoT Hub account.
1. Look for **Shared access policies** in the left pane and select it.
1. Select the policy named **iothubowner**.
1. Copy the **Primary connection string** value. It will look like `HostName=xxx.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=XXX`.

### Connect to IoT Hub

1. Open Visual Studio Code and select **View** > **Explorer**. Or, select Ctrl+Shift+E.
1. In the lower-left corner of the **Explorer** tab, select **Azure IoT Hub**.
1. Select the **More Options** icon to see the context menu. Then select **Set IoT Hub Connection String**.
1. When an input box appears, enter your IoT Hub connection string.
1. In about 30 seconds, refresh Azure IoT Hub in the lower-left section. You should see your device ID, which should have the following modules deployed:

   - Video Analyzer edge module (module name **avaedge**)
   - RTSP simulator (module name **rtspsim**)

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-detect-motion-emit-events/modules-node.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the expanded Modules node.":::

> [!TIP]
> If you have [manually deployed Video Analyzer](deploy-iot-edge-device.md) on an edge device (such as an ARM64 device), the module will appear under that device, under Azure IoT Hub. You can select that module and continue with the following steps.

### Prepare to monitor the modules

When you use this quickstart, events will be sent to IoT Hub. To see these events, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **Extensions** tab (or select Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for **Azure IoT Hub**.
1. Right-click the IoT Hub extension and select **Extension Settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-detect-motion-emit-events/extension-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the selection of Extension Settings.":::

1. Search for and enable **Show Verbose Message**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-detect-motion-emit-events/verbose-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Show Verbose Message enabled.":::

1. Open the **Explorer** pane in Visual Studio Code, and look for **Azure IoT Hub** in the lower-left corner.
1. Expand the **Devices** node.
1. Right-click your device ID, and select **Start Monitoring Built-in Event Endpoint**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You might be asked to provide built-in endpoint information for IoT Hub. To get that information, in the Azure portal, go to your IoT Hub account and look for **Built-in endpoints** in the left pane. Select it and look for the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint** section. Copy and use the text in the box. The endpoint will look something like this:
   >
   > ```
   > Endpoint=sb://iothub-ns-xxx.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=XXX;EntityPath=<IoT Hub name>
   > ```

## Use direct method calls

You can now analyze live video streams by invoking direct methods that the Video Analyzer edge module exposes. Read [Video Analyzer direct methods](direct-methods.md) to examine all the direct methods that the module provides.

### Enumerate pipeline topologies

This step enumerates all the [pipeline topologies](pipeline.md) in the module.

1. Right-click the **avaedge** module and select **Invoke Module Direct Method** from the shortcut menu.
1. Type **pipelineTopologyList** in the edit box and select the Enter key.
1. Copy the following JSON payload and paste it in the edit box, and then select the Enter key.

   ```json
   {
     "@apiVersion": "1.0"
   }
   ```

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```
[DirectMethod] Invoking Direct Method [pipelineTopologyList] to [deviceId/avaedge] ...
[DirectMethod] Response from [deviceId/avaedge]:
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {
    "value": []
  }
}
```

That response is expected, because no pipeline topologies have been created.

### Set a pipeline topology

By using the same steps described earlier, you can invoke `pipelineTopologySet` to set a pipeline topology by using the following JSON as the payload. You'll create a pipeline topology named _MotionDetection_.

```json
{
  "@apiVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "MotionDetection",
  "properties": {
    "description": "Analyzing live video to detect motion and emit events",
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "rtspUrl",
        "type": "string",
        "description": "rtspUrl"
      },
      {
        "name": "rtspUserName",
        "type": "string",
        "description": "rtspUserName",
        "default": "dummyUserName"
      },
      {
        "name": "rtspPassword",
        "type": "string",
        "description": "rtspPassword",
        "default": "dummypw"
      }
    ],
    "sources": [
      {
        "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.RtspSource",
        "name": "rtspSource",
        "transport": "tcp",
        "endpoint": {
          "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.UnsecuredEndpoint",
          "credentials": {
            "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.UsernamePasswordCredentials",
            "username": "${rtspUserName}",
            "password": "${rtspPassword}"
          },
          "url": "${rtspUrl}"
        }
      }
    ],
    "processors": [
      {
        "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.MotionDetectionProcessor",
        "sensitivity": "medium",
        "name": "motionDetection",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "nodeName": "rtspSource",
            "outputSelectors": []
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "sinks": [
      {
        "hubOutputName": "inferenceOutput",
        "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.IotHubMessageSink",
        "name": "iotHubSink",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "nodeName": "motionDetection"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This JSON payload creates a topology that defines three parameters, two of which have default values. The topology has one source node ([RTSP source](pipeline.md#rtsp-source)), one processor node ([motion detection processor](pipeline.md#motion-detection-processor), and one sink node ([IoT Hub message sink](pipeline.md#iot-hub-message-sink)). The payload shows the visual representation of the topology.

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```json

              "username": "${rtspUserName}",
              "password": "${rtspPassword}"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "processors": [

          "name": "motionDetection",
          "inputs": [
            {
              "nodeName": "rtspSource",
              "outputSelectors": []
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "sinks": [
        {

              "outputSelectors": []
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The returned status is 201. This status indicates that a new topology was created.

Try the following next steps:

- Invoke `pipelineTopologySet` again. The returned status code is 200. This code indicates that an existing topology was successfully updated.
- Invoke `pipelineTopologySet` again, but change the description string. The returned status code is 200, and the description is updated to the new value.
- Invoke `pipelineTopologyList` as outlined in the previous section. Now you can see the _MotionDetection_ topology in the returned payload.

### Read the pipeline topology

Invoke `pipelineTopologyGet` by using the following payload:

```json
{
  "@apiVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "MotionDetection"
}
```

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

          "inputs": [
            {
              "nodeName": "motionDetection",
              "outputSelectors": []
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the response payload, notice these details:

- The status code is 200, indicating success.
- The payload includes the `createdAt` time stamp and the `lastModifiedAt` time stamp.

### Create a live pipeline by using the topology

Next, create a live pipeline that references the preceding pipeline topology. Invoke the `livePipelineSet` direct method with the following payload:

```json
{
  "@apiVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "mdpipeline1",
  "properties": {
    "topologyName": "MotionDetection",
    "description": "Sample pipeline description",
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "rtspUrl",
        "value": "rtsp://rtspsim:554/media/camera-300s.mkv"
      },
      {
        "name": "rtspUserName",
        "value": "testuser"
      },
      {
        "name": "rtspPassword",
        "value": "testpassword"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Notice that this payload:

- Specifies the topology (_MotionDetection_) that the live pipeline will use.
- Contains a parameter value for `rtspUrl`, which did not have a default value in the topology payload. This value is a link to the following sample video:

Within few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```json
{
  "status": 201,
  "payload": {
    "systemData": {
      "createdAt": "2021-03-21T18:27:41.639Z",
      "lastModifiedAt": "2021-03-21T18:27:41.639Z"
    },
    "name": "mdpipeline1",
    "properties": {
      "state": "Inactive",
      "description": "Sample pipeline description",
      "topologyName": "MotionDetection",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "rtspPassword",
          "value": "testpassword"
        },
        {
          "name": "rtspUrl",
          "value": "rtsp://rtspsim:554/media/camera-300s.mkv"
        },
        {
          "name": "rtspUserName",
          "value": "testuser"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the response payload, notice that:

- The status code is 201, indicating a new live pipeline was created.
- The state is `Inactive`, indicating that the live pipeline was created but not activated. For more information, see [Pipeline states](pipeline.md#pipeline-states).

Try the following direct methods as next steps:

- Invoke `livePipelineSet` again with the same payload. Note that the returned status code is now 200.
- Invoke `livePipelineSet` again but with a different description. Note the updated description in the response payload, indicating that the live pipeline was successfully updated.
- Invoke `livePipelineSet`, but change the name to `mdpipeline2` and change `rtspUrl` to `rtsp://rtspsim:554/media/lots_015.mkv`. In the response payload, note the newly created live pipeline (that is, status code 201).

  > [!NOTE]
  > As explained in [Pipeline topologies](pipeline.md#pipeline-topologies), you can create multiple live pipelines, to analyze live video streams from many cameras by using the same pipeline topology. If you create more live pipelines, take care to delete them during the cleanup step.

### Activate the live pipeline

You can activate the live pipeline to start the flow of (simulated) live video through the pipeline. Invoke the direct method `livePipelineActivate` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "@apiVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "mdpipeline1"
}
```

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

The status code of 200 indicates that the live pipeline was successfully activated.

### Check the state of the live pipeline

Invoke the `livePipelineGet` direct method with the following payload:

```json
{
  "@apiVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "mdpipeline1"
}
```

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {
    "systemData": {
      "createdAt": "2021-03-21T18:27:41.639Z",
      "lastModifiedAt": "2021-03-21T18:27:41.639Z"
    },
    "name": "mdpipeline1",
    "properties": {
      "state": "Active",
      "description": "Sample pipeline description",
      "topologyName": "MotionDetection",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "rtspPassword",
          "value": "testpassword"
        },
        {
          "name": "rtspUrl",
          "value": "rtsp://rtspsim:554/media/camera-300s.mkv"
        },
        {
          "name": "rtspUserName",
          "value": "testuser"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the response payload, notice the following details:

- The status code is 200, indicating success.
- The state is `Active`, indicating that the live pipeline is now active.

## Observe results

The live pipeline that you created and activated uses the motion detection processor node to detect motion in the incoming live video stream and sends events to the IoT Hub sink. These events are then relayed to IoT Hub as messages, which can now be observed. Messages in the **OUTPUT** window will have the following "body":

```json
{
  "timestamp": 145471641211899,
  "inferences": [
    {
      "type": "motion",
      "motion": {
        "box": {
          "l": 0.514644,
          "t": 0.574627,
          "w": 0.3375,
          "h": 0.096296
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `inferences` section indicates that the type is motion. It provides more data about the motion event. It also provides a bounding box for the region of the video frame (at the given time stamp) where motion was detected.

## Invoke more direct method calls to clean up

Next, you can invoke direct methods to deactivate and delete the live pipeline (in that order).

### Deactivate the live pipeline

Invoke the`livePipelineDeactivate` direct method with the following payload:

```json
{
  "@apiVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "mdpipeline1"
}
```

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

The status code of 200 indicates that the live pipeline was successfully deactivated.

Next, try to invoke `livePipelineGet` as indicated previously in this article. Observe the state value.

### Delete the live pipeline

Invoke the direct method `livePipelineDelete` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "@apiVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "mdpipeline1"
}
```

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

A status code of 200 indicates that the live pipeline was successfully deleted.

If you also created the pipeline called _mdpipeline2_, then you can't delete the pipeline topology without also deleting this additional pipeline. Invoke the direct method `livePipelineDelete` again by using the following payload:

```
{
    "@apiVersion" : "1.0",
    "name" : "mdpipeline2"
}
```

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

A status code of 200 indicates that the live pipeline was successfully deleted.

You can invoke `livePipelineList` by using the same payload as `pipelineTopologyList`. Observe that no live pipelines are enumerated.

### Delete the pipeline topology

After all live pipelines have been deleted, you can invoke the `pipelineTopologyDelete` direct method with the following payload:

```json
{
  "@apiVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "MotionDetection"
}
```

Within a few seconds, the following response appears in the **OUTPUT** window:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

A status code of 200 indicates that the topology was successfully deleted.

You can try to invoke `pipelineTopologyList` and observe that the module contains no topologies.
