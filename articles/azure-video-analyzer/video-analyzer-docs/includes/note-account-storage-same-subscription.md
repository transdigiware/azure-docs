> [!NOTE]
> You'll need an Azure subscription where you have access to both the [Contributor](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) role and the [User Access Administrator](../../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) role to the resource group under which you'll create new resources (user-assigned managed identity, storage account, Video Analyzer account). If you don't have the right permissions, ask your account administrator to grant you those permissions. The associated storage account must be in the same region as the Video Analyzer account. We recommend that you use a [standard general-purpose v2](../../../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md#types-of-storage-accounts) storage account.
