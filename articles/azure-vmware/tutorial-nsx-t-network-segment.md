# Tutorial: Add a network segment in Azure VMware Solution 

After deploying Azure VMware Solution, you can configure an NSX-T network segment either from NSX-T Manager or the Azure portal.  Once configured, the segments are visible in Azure VMware Solution, NSX-T Manger, and vCenter.  NSX-T comes pre-previsioned by default with an NSX-T Tier-0 gateway in **Active/Active** mode and a default NSX-T Tier-1 gateway in **Active/Standby** mode.  These gateways let you connect the segments (logical switches) and provide East-West and North-South connectivity. 

>[!TIP]
>The Azure portal presents a simplified view of NSX-T operations a VMware administrator needs regularly and targeted at users not familiar with NSX-T Manager. 


In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Add network segments using either NSX-T Manager or the Azure portal
> * Verify the new network segment 

## Prerequisites

An Azure VMware Solution private cloud with access to the vCenter and NSX-T Manager interfaces. For more information, see the [Configure networking](tutorial-configure-networking.md) tutorial.

## Use NSX-T Manager to add network segment 

The virtual machines (VMs) created in vCenter are placed onto the network segments created in NSX-T and are visible in vCenter.

## Use Azure portal to add an NSX-T segment

[!INCLUDE [create-nsxt-segment-azure-portal-steps](includes/create-nsxt-segment-azure-portal-steps.md)]


## Verify the new network segment

Verify the presence of the new network segment. In this example, **ls01** is the new network segment.

1. In NSX-T Manager, select **Networking** > **Segments**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an NSX-T network segment to use for VMs in vCenter.
