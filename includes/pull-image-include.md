> [!NOTE]
> The following example pulls a public container image from Docker Hub. We recommend that you authenticate with your Docker Hub account (`docker login`) first instead of making an anonymous pull request. To improve reliability when using public content, import and manage the image in a private Azure container registry. [Learn more about working with public images](../articles/container-registry/buffer-gate-public-content.md).
