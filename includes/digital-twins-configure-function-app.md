You can set up security access for the function app by using either the Azure CLI or the Azure portal. Follow the steps for your preferred option.

# [CLI](#tab/cli)

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-configure-function-app-cli.md](digital-twins-configure-function-app-cli.md)]

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

Complete the following steps in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

#### Assign an access role

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-permissions-required.md](digital-twins-permissions-required.md)]

A system-assigned managed identity enables Azure resources to authenticate to cloud services (for example, Azure Key Vault) without storing credentials in code. After you enable system-assigned managed identity, all necessary permissions can be granted through Azure role-based access control. 

The lifecycle of this type of managed identity is tied to the lifecycle of this resource. Additionally, each resource can have only one system-assigned managed identity.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), search for your function app by typing its name in the search box. Select your app from the results.

1. On the function app page, in the menu on the left, select __Identity__ to work with a managed identity for the function. On the __System assigned__ page, verify that the __Status__ is set to **On**. If it's not, set it now and then **Save** the change.

1. On the __Add role assignment (Preview)__ page, select the following values:

    * **Scope**: _Resource group_
    * **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
    * **Resource group**: Select your resource group.
    * **Role**: _Azure Digital Twins Data Owner_

    Save the details by selecting __Save__.

#### Configure application settings

To make the URL of your Azure Digital Twins instance accessible to your function, you can set an environment variable. Application settings are exposed as environment variables to allow access to the Azure Digital Twins instance. For more information about environment variables, see [Manage your function app](../articles/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md?tabs=portal). 

To set an environment variable with the URL of your instance, first find your instance's host name: 

1. Search for your instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
1. In the menu on the left, select __Overview__. 
1. Copy the __Host name__ value.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/digital-twins/media/how-to-create-azure-function/instance-host-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. On the instance's Overview page, the host name value is highlighted.":::

You can now create an application setting:

1. In the portal search bar, search for your function app and then select it from the results.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/digital-twins/media/how-to-create-azure-function/portal-search-for-function-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. The function app's name is being searched in the portal search bar. The search result is highlighted.":::

1. On the left, select __Configuration__. Then on the __Application settings__ tab, select __+ New application setting__.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/digital-twins/media/how-to-create-azure-function/application-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. On the Configuration tab for the function app, the button to create a New application setting is highlighted.":::

1. In the window that opens, use the host name value you copied to create an application setting.
    * **Name**: ADT_SERVICE_URL
    * **Value**: https://<your-Azure-Digital-Twins-host-name>
    
    Select __OK__ to create an application setting.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../articles/digital-twins/media/how-to-create-azure-function/add-application-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. On the Add/Edit application setting page, the Name and Value fields are filled out. The O K button is highlighted.":::

1. After you create the setting, it should appear on the __Application settings__ tab. Verify that **ADT_SERVICE_URL** appears on the list. Then save the new application setting by selecting __Save__.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/digital-twins/media/how-to-create-azure-function/application-setting-save-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. On the application settings tab, the new A D T SERVICE URL setting and the Save button are both highlighted.":::

1. Any changes to the application settings require an application restart, so select __Continue__ to restart your application when prompted.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/digital-twins/media/how-to-create-azure-function/save-application-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. A note states that any changes to application settings will restart your application.":::
