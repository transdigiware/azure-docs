## Configure the account information

The next step is to configure the app to use your account information. You took note of the **Account Key**, **Account ID**, and **Account Domain** values, in the ["Create an Object Anchors account"](#create-an-object-anchors-account) section.

On the **Project** pane, go to `Assets\AzureObjectAnchors.SDK\Resources`. 

Select **ObjectAnchorsConfig**. On the **Inspector** pane, enter the `Account Key` as the value for **Object Anchors Account Key**, the `Account ID` as the value for **Object Anchors Account Id**, and the `Account Domain` as the value for **Object Anchors Account Domain**.
