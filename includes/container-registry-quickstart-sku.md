> [!TIP]
> In this quickstart, you create a *Basic* registry, which is a cost-optimized option for developers learning about Azure Container Registry. Choose other tiers for increased storage and image throughput, and capabilities such as connection using a [private endpoint](../articles/container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md). For details on available service tiers (SKUs), see [Container registry service tiers](../articles/container-registry/container-registry-skus.md).
