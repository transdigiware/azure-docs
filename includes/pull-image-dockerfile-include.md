> [!NOTE]
> The Dockerfile used in the following example depends on a public base container image from Docker Hub. To improve reliability when using public content, import and manage the image in a private Azure container registry, and update your Dockerfile to use your privately managed base image. [Learn more about working with public images](../articles/container-registry/buffer-gate-public-content.md).
