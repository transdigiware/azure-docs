> [!NOTE]
> Azure provides an default outbound access IP for Azure Virtual Machines which aren't assigned a public IP address, or are in the backend pool of an internal Basic Azure Load Balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable. 
>
>The default outbound access IP is disabled when a public IP address is assigned to the virtual machine or the virtual machine is placed in the backend pool of a Standard Load Balancer with or without outbound rules. If a [Azure Virtual Network NAT](../articles/virtual-network/nat-overview.md) gateway resource is assigned to the subnet of the virtual machine, the default outbound access IP is disabled.
